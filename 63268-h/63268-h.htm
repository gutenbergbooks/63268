<span class="smaller">ABERCORRAN STREET</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="noindent">My story is of Balham and of a family dwelling
in Balham who were more Welsh than Balhamitish.
Strangers to that neighbourhood who
go up Harrington Road from the tram must
often wonder why the second turning on the
right is called Abercorran Street: the few who
know Abercorran town itself, the long grey
and white street, with a castle at one end, low
down by the river mouth, and an old church
high up at the other, must be delighted by the
memories thus recalled, but they also must
wonder at the name. Abercorran Street is
straight, flat, symmetrically lined on both sides
by four-bedroomed houses in pairs, and it runs
at right angles out of Harrington Road into
another road which the pair of four-bedroomed
houses visible at the corner proclaim to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
exactly like it. The only external variety in the
street is created by the absence from two of the
cast-iron gates of any notice prohibiting the
entrance of hawkers and canvassers.</p>

<p>When I myself first saw the white lettering
on a blue ground of <span class="allsmcap">ABERCORRAN STREET</span> I was
perhaps more surprised than most others have
been who paid any attention to it. I was surprised
but not puzzled. I knew very well why
it was called Abercorran Street. For I knew
Abercorran House and the Morgans, its inhabitants,
and the dogs and the pigeons thereof.
Who that ever knew the house and the people
could ever forget them? I knew the Morgans,
the father and mother, the five sons, the one
daughter Jessie. I knew the house down to the
kitchen, because I knew old Ann, the one permanent&mdash;I
had almost written immortal&mdash;servant,
of whom it was said by one knowing the facts,
that they also rule who only serve and wait. I
knew the breakfast room where breakfast was
never finished; the dark Library where they
had all the magazines which have since died
of their virtues; the room without a name
which was full of fishing-rods, walking-sticks,
guns, traps, the cross-bow, boxes of skins, birds’
eggs, papers, old books, pictures, pebbles from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
a hundred beaches, and human bones. I knew
the conservatory crowded with bicycles and
what had been tricycles. I knew as well as any
one the pigeon-houses, the one on a pole and
the one which was originally a fowl-house, built
with some idea or fancy regarding profit. I
knew that well-worn square of blackened gravel
at the foot of the back steps, where everybody
had to pass to go to the conservatory, the
pigeon-houses, and the wild garden beyond,
and where the sun was always shining on men
and children and dogs. This square was railed
off from the rest of the garden. That also I
knew, its four-and-twenty elms that stood about
the one oak in the long grass and buttercups
and docks, like a pleasant company slowly and
unwillingly preparing to leave that three-acre
field which was the garden of Abercorran House
and called by us The Wilderness&mdash;a name now
immortalised, because the christener of streets
has given it to the one beyond Abercorran
Street. Under the trees lay a pond containing
golden water-lilies and carp. A pond needs
nothing else except boys like us to make the best
of it. Yet we never could fish in it again after
the strange girl was drawn out of it dead one
morning: nobody knew who she was or why she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
had climbed over into the Wilderness to drown
herself; yet Ann seemed to know, and so
perhaps did the tall Roland, but both of them
could lock up anything they wished to keep
secret and throw away the key. I knew the
elms and the one oak of the Wilderness as well
as the jackdaws did. For I knew them night
and day, and the birds knew nothing of them
between half-past five on an October evening
and half-past five the next morning.</p>

<p>To-day the jackdaws at least, if ever they
fly that way, can probably not distinguish
Abercorran Street and Wilderness Street from
ordinary streets. For the trees are every one
of them gone, and with them the jackdaws.
The lilies and carp are no longer in the pond,
and there is no pond. I can understand people
cutting down trees&mdash;it is a trade and brings
profit&mdash;but not draining a pond in such a garden
as the Wilderness and taking all its carp home
to fry in the same fat as bloaters, all for the
sake of building a house that might just as well
have been anywhere else or nowhere at all.
I think No. 23 Wilderness Street probably has
the honour and misfortune to stand in the
pond’s place, but they call it <span class="smcap">Lyndhurst</span>.
Ann shares my opinion, and she herself is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
living in the house behind, No. 21 Abercorran
Street.</p>

<p>Ann likes the new houses as well as the old
elm-trees, and the hundreds of men, women,
and children as well as the jackdaws&mdash;which is
saying a good deal; for she loved both trees and
birds, and I have heard her assert that the
birds frequently talked in Welsh as the jackdaws
used to do at the castle of Abercorran; but
when I asked her why she thought so and what
they said, she grew touchy and said: “Well,
they did not speak English, whatever, and if it
was Welsh, as I think, you cannot expect me
to pervert Welsh into English, for I am no
scholar.” She is keeping house now for the
gentleman at 21 Abercorran Street, a Mr Henry
Jones. She would probably have been satisfied
with him in any case, since he is the means by
which Ann remains alive, free to think her own
thoughts and to bake her own bread; to drink
tea for breakfast, tea for dinner, tea for tea, tea
for supper, and tea in between; to eat also at
long intervals a quart of cockles from Abercorran
shore, and a baked apple dumpling to follow;
and at night to read the Welsh Bible and a Guide
to the Antiquities of Abercorran. But Ann is
more than satisfied because Mr Jones is Welsh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
She admits his claim in spite of her unconcealed
opinion that his Dolgelly Welsh, of which she
can hardly understand a word, she says, is not
Welsh at all. Of his speech as of the jackdaws
she can retort: “He does not speak English,
whatever.”</p>

<p>Ann will never leave him unless he or she
should die. She is untidy; she has never
decided what is truth; and she has her own
affairs as well as his to manage; but, as he says
himself, he has entertained an angel unawares
and she is not to be thrust out. He covers his
inability to command her by asking what she
could do at her age if she had to leave. It is
not likely that Mr Henry Jones could get the
better of a woman whom&mdash;in spite of the fact
that she has never decided what is truth&mdash;he has
called an angel. For he did not use the word
as a mere compliment, as much as to say that she
was all that a woman should be when she is in
domestic service. She is not; she is excellent
only at pastry, which Mr Jones believes that he
ought never to touch. He has been heard to
call her “half angel and half bird”; but neither
does this furnish the real explanation, though it
offers an obvious one. For Ann is now&mdash;I mean
that when we were children she seemed as old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
as she seems now; she limps too; and yet it
might partly be her limp that made Mr Jones
call her “half bird,” for it is brisk and quite
unashamed, almost a pretty limp; also she is
pale with a shining paleness, and often she is
all eyes, because her eyes are large and round
and dark, looking always up at you and always
a little sidelong&mdash;but that alone would not
justify a sensible man in calling her “half
angel.” Nor would her voice, which has a remarkable
unexpectedness, wherever and whenever
it is heard. She begins abruptly in the
middle of a thought without a word or gesture
of preparation, and always on an unexpectedly
high note. In this she is like the robin, who
often rehearses the first half of his song in
silence and then suddenly continues aloud, as
if he were beginning in mid-song. Well, Mr
Henry Jones, as I have said, once called her
“half angel and half bird,” and declared that
he had entertained an angel unawares in Ann,
and I believe that he is right and more than a
sensible man. For he has grasped the prime
fact that she is not what she seems.</p>

<p>For my part I can say that she is such a
woman that her name, Ann Lewis, has for those
who connect it with her, and with her alone, out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of all the inhabitants of earth, a curious lightness,
something at once pretty and old with an
elfish oldness, something gay and a little weird,
also a bird-like delicacy, as delicate as “linnet”
and “martin.” If these words are useless,
remember at least that, though half bird, she is
not a mere human travesty or hint of a winged
thing, and that she is totally unlike any other
bird, and probably unlike any other angel.</p>

<p>An ordinary bird certainly&mdash;and an ordinary
angel probably&mdash;would have pined away at 21
Abercorran Street after having lived at Abercorran
House and at Abercorran itself. But
Ann is just the same as when I last saw her in
Abercorran House. She alone that day was
unchanged. The house, the Wilderness, the conservatory,
the pigeon-houses, all were changed;
I was changed, but not Ann. Yet the family had
then newly gone, leaving her alone in the house.
It was some years since I had been there. They
had been going on as ever in that idle, careless,
busy life which required a big country house and
an illimitable playground of moor and mountain
for a full and fitting display. Gradually their
friends grew up, went to a university, to business,
or abroad, and acquired preferences which
were not easily to be adapted to that sunny,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
untidy house. At first these friends would be
only too glad to go round to Abercorran House
of an evening after business, or a morning or
two after the beginning of the vacation. Perhaps
they came again, and after a long interval
yet again. They said it was different: but
they were wrong; it was they themselves were
different; the Morgans never changed. In
this way young men of the neighbourhood discovered
that they were no longer boys. They
could no longer put up with that careless hullabaloo
of lazy, cheerful people, they took offence
at the laziness, or else at the cheerfulness.
Also they saw that Jessie, the girl, was as frank
and untidy at seventeen as she had always
been, and it took them aback, especially if
they were wanting to make love to her. The
thought of it made them feel foolish against
their will. They fancied that she would laugh.
Yet it was easy to believe that Jessie might
die for love or for a lover. When somebody
was pitying the girl who drowned herself
in the Wilderness pond, Jessie interrupted:
“She isn’t a <i>poor girl</i>; she is dead; it is you are
poor; she has got what she wanted, and some
of you don’t know what you want, and if you
did you would be afraid of cold water.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
young men could see the power of such words
in Jessie’s eye, and they did not make love to
her. Some took their revenge by calling her
a slut, which was what Ann used to call her
when she was affectionate, as she could be to
Jessie only. “Come on, there’s a slut,” she
used to say. It was too familiar for the youths,
but some of them would have liked to use it,
because they felt that the phrase was somehow
as amorous as it was curt, a sort of blow that
was as fond as a kiss. Even when, in their hard
hats at the age of twenty or so, they used the
term, in condemnation, they would still have
given their hats for courage to speak it as Ann
did, and say: “Come on, Jessie, there’s a slut”;
for they would have had to kiss her after the
word, both because they could not help it, and
for fear she should misunderstand its significance.
At any rate, I believe that nobody but Ann
ever addressed that term of utmost endearment
to Jessie.</p>

<p>Thus was there one reason the less for boys
who were growing up, ceasing to tear the
knees of their trousers and so on, to frequent
Abercorran House. I lingered on, but the death
of one there had set me painfully free. After
a time I used to go chiefly to honour an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
custom, which proved an inadequate motive.
Then year after year, of course, it was easier to
put off revisiting, and one day when I went,
only Ann was left. She had her kitchen and
her own room; the rest of the house had no
visible inhabitants. Yet Ann would not have
it that it was sad. “It does a house good,”
she said, “to have all those Morgans in
it. Now they have gone back again to Abercorran
in the county of Caermarthen, and I am
sure they are all happy but the mistress, and
she was incurable; that was all; and there
was an end of it at last.” Ann herself was
staying on as caretaker till Abercorran House
was let or sold.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MORGANS OF ABERCORRAN HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">In spite of old Ann and her kitchen fire I did
not stay long in the house that day. The
removal which had left it deserted and silent
had made it also a little sordid: the family’s
ways, for example, had not agreed with the
wall-paper, and they had been no enemies to
spiders. So I went out into the yard. There
were no dogs; all had gone with the Morgans
to Abercorran. The only life was a single homeless
blue pigeon flying about in search of the
home which had been sold. Ann said that
almost every one of the birds had returned in
this way, and she called the traveller into the
kitchen to wait until its purchaser came in
search of it. She told me who he was, and
much more about the sale, which I forgot or
never heard, because the sun shone very warmly
into the yard just then, and I could not help
seeing them all again, Jack and Roland, Lewis
and Harry, and Jessie, and Philip, too, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
was at sixteen, and the dogs,&mdash;Ladas the greyhound,
Bully the bull-terrier, Granfer the dachshund,
Spot the fox-terrier, and pigeons here
and there among them, and some perched on
roof and chimneys, some flying so high that
they were no bigger than larks&mdash;and Mr Morgan
at the top of the steps looking at it all and
seeing that it was good. Often had I come
upon them in this pattern, not knowing at
first whether to join this group or that, the
busy or the idle.</p>

<p>In those days Abercorran House stood at
the end of a short, quiet street which had only
six houses in it, all on the right-hand side
going up, all roomy and respectable, monuments
of Albert the Good’s age, well covered with
creepers, screened by a continuous line of lime-trees
and in most cases by laurel, lilac, and
balsam in compact shrubberies. Opposite the
houses a high wall ran along until, at Abercorran
House, the street was cut short by an oak fence.
Behind that fence, and occupying as much
ground as all the other houses and gardens
together, lay the Abercorran garden, the Wilderness,
which was bounded and given its triangular
shape by a main road&mdash;now Harrington Road&mdash;and
a farm lane. Impenetrable hedges and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
unscaleable fences protected the garden from
the world.</p>

<p>I cannot say how it had come about that
these three acres became attached to the house
which so well deserved them. From the outside
nobody would have suspected it. Abercorran
House was in no practical respect superior
to its neighbours; presumably the land beyond
the fence was another property, or it would
not have been allowed to cut short the street.
But so it was. You entered the carriage gate
on your right&mdash;there was no carriage&mdash;passed
round the right side of the house into the yard
at the back, turned to the left across it and
went between the conservatory and the pigeon
house out into the Wilderness.</p>

<p>The house was distinguished, to the casual
eye, by the lack of coloured or white curtains,
the never-shut gate, the flourishing, untended
lilac hiding the front door and lower windows
except in winter. But for me it is hard to
admit that Abercorran House had anything
in common, except building material, with the
other five&mdash;The Elms, Orchard Lea, Brockenhurst,
and Candelent Gate, and I forget the
other. The street was called Candelent Street;
God knows why, but there may be someone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
who knows as much about Candelent Gate as
I do of Abercorran House.</p>

<p>These houses showed signs of pride and
affluence. Their woodwork was frequently
painted; the gravel was renewed; the knockers
and letter-boxes gleamed; their inhabitants
were always either neat or gaudy; even the
servants were chosen half for their good looks,
and were therefore continually being changed.
At the Elms lived several people and a great
Dane; at Orchard Lea a wire-haired terrier with
a silver collar; at Candelent Gate a sort of
whippet; at the house whose name I have forgotten,
three pugs. These dogs all liked the
Morgans’ house for one reason or another:
men and dogs and food were always to be found
there. The dogs’ owners never got so far up
the street as that, though they sometimes sent
to ask if Bunter the wire-haired terrier, or
Lofty the Dane, or Silvermoon the whippet, were
there, or to complain about one of some score
of things which they disliked, as, for example,
the conduct of the dogs (especially Bully, who
was damned at first sight for his looks), the use
of the hundred yards of roadway as a running
ground, Jessie’s entering the races in a costume
which enabled her to win, the noise of boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
whistling at the pigeons, the number of the
pigeons, the visits of almost verminous-looking
strangers who had forgotten the name of the
house and tried The Elms, or Candelent Gate,
or Orchard Lea, or Brockenhurst, before discovering
the Morgans. In return, Mr Morgan
regretted the nature of things and the incompatibility
of temperaments, and he forbade
racing in the street; but as races were always
an inspiration, they recurred. As for Jessie’s
clothes, his opinion was that his neighbours,
being fools, should look the other way or pull
down their blinds. He did not see why
Godiva should complain of Peeping Tom, or
Peeping Tom of Godiva. As for the difficulty in
remembering the name of the house, he saw
no reason for changing it; all his friends and
his children’s friends could see instantly that
neither The Elms, nor Orchard Lea, nor Brockenhurst,
nor Candelent Gate, nor the other house,
was his, and he could not think of consulting
those who were not his friends.</p>

<p>Abercorran House was honoured by four
martins’ nests under the eaves, placed at such
regular intervals that they appeared to be
corbels for supporting the roof. Not one of
the other houses in the street had a martin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
nest. But the distinguishing feature of the
Morgans’ house was that you could see at a
glance that it was the Morgans’. The front
garden was merely a way round to the yard
and the Wilderness. Altogether the front of
the house, facing east, must have looked to a
stranger uninhabited. Everything was done on
the other side, or in the yard. Bounded on
the east by the house, on the north or Brockenhurst
side by a high wall (built by Mr Brockenhurst,
as we called him), and on the west or
lane side by a split oak fence, but separated
from the Wilderness and the south only by the
conservatory and the pigeon-house and some
low railings, the yard of Abercorran House
was a reservoir of sun. The high south wall
was occupied, not by fruit trees, but by cascades
of ivy and by men and boys standing or sitting
in the sun, talking, watching the jackdaws
coming and going in the elms of the Wilderness,
and also by dogs gnawing bones or sleeping.
There was no cultivated garden, but several of
the corners had always some blossoms of wall-flower,
sweet-rocket, or snapdragon, that looked
after themselves: in the pocket between the
fence and the pigeon house half a dozen sunflowers
invariably found a way of growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
eight feet high and expanding enormous blossoms,
every one of them fit to be copied and stuck up
for a sign outside the “Sun” inn.</p>

<p>Nobody could mistake Abercorran House;
but in case anybody did, Mr Morgan had a brass
plate with “T. Ll. Morgan” on it at the foot
of his front steps, in a position where to see it
from the road was impossible. This plate was
always bright: the only time when I saw it
dim was when Ann was alone in the deserted
house. A succession of active, dirty, little
maids employed in the house agreed upon this
one point, that the name-plate must be polished
until it reflected their cheeks as they reflected
its never-understood glory. No vainglorious
initial letters followed the name, nor any descriptive
word. The maids&mdash;Lizz, Kate, Ellen,
Polly, Hannah, Victoria, and the rest&mdash;probably
knew no more than I ever did why the
name was there. For it was perfectly clear
that Mr Morgan never did or wished to do
anything. The name might just as well have
been that of some famous man born there a
hundred years before: in any case it had nothing
to do with that expression the house had of
frankness, mystery, untidiness, ease, and something
like rusticity. In the yard behind, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
bull terrier stood for frankness, the greyhound
for rusticity, the cats for mystery, and most
things for untidiness, and all for ease.</p>

<p>Indoors it was a dark house. Windows were
numerous, but it was undoubtedly dark. This
was in part due to comparison with the outer
air, where people lived as much as possible, and
especially with the sunlit yard. The house had,
however, a dark spirit, aided by the folds of
heavy curtains, the massive, old, blackened
furniture, and the wall-paper of some years
before. You wandered as you pleased about
it, alone or with Philip, Lewis, or Harry. Most
of the rooms were bedrooms, but not conspicuous
as such when strewn with cases of butterflies,
birds’ eggs and nests, stuffed animals, cages
containing foreign birds, several blackbirds,
a nest of young thrushes, an adder and some
ringed snakes and lizards, a hedgehog, white
and piebald rats and mice, fishing-rods and
tackle, pistols and guns and toy cannon, tools
and half-made articles of many kinds, model
steam-engines, a model of the “Victory” and
a painting of the “Owen Glendower” under a
flock of sail, boxing gloves, foils, odds and ends
of wood and metal, curiosities from tree and
stone, everything that can be accumulated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
curious and unruly minds; and then also the
owners themselves and their friends, plotting,
arguing, examining their property, tending the
living animals or skinning the dead, boxing,
fencing, firing cannon, and going to and
fro.</p>

<p>The kitchen, the Library, and Mrs Morgan’s
room were silent rooms. In the kitchen Ann
ruled. It smelt of an old Bible and new cakes:
its sole sound was Ann’s voice singing in Welsh,
which was often stopped abruptly by her duties
coming to a head, or by something outside&mdash;as
when she heard Lewis overtaxing Granfer in
teaching it a trick and flitted out, saying:
“Don’t use the dog like that. Anyone might
think he had no human feelings.” She must
have been, in a sense, young in those days, but
was unlike any other young woman I have seen,
and it never occurred to me then to think of her
as one; nor, as certainly, did it seem possible that
she would grow old&mdash;and she has not grown old.
When she left her kitchen it was seldom to go
out. Except to do the household shopping,
and that was always after dark, she never
went beyond the yard. She did not like being
laughed at for her looks and accent, and she
disliked London so much as to keep out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
London air, as far as possible, with closed
windows.</p>

<p>I do not remember ever to have seen Ann
talking to her mistress, and no doubt she did
without her. Mrs Morgan was not to be seen
about the house, and her room was perfectly
respected. She sat at the window looking on
to the yard and watched the boys as she sewed,
or read, or pretended to read. Sometimes
Jessie sat with her, and then I have seen her
smiling. She had large eyes of a gloomy lustre
which looked as if they had worn their hollows
in the gaunt face by much gazing and still
more musing. The boys were silent for a
moment as they went past her door. I do not
know when she went out, if she ever did, but
I never saw her even in the yard. Nor did I
see her with Mr Morgan, and it was known that
he was never in her sitting-room. She seemed
to live uncomplaining under a weight of gloom,
looking out from under it upon her strong sons
and their busy indolence, with admiration and
also a certain dread.</p>

<p>Jessie was the favourite child of father and
mother, but I used to think that it was to avoid
her father that she was so often in her mother’s
room. Why else should such a child of light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and liberty stay in that quietness and dark
silence which breathed out darkness over the
house? Outside that room she was her brothers’
equal in boldness, merriment and even in
strength. Yet it once struck me with some
horror, as she sat up at the window, that she
was like her mother&mdash;too much like her&mdash;the
dark eyes large, the cheeks not any too plump,
the expression sobered either by some fear of
her own or by the conversation; it struck me
that she might some day by unimaginable steps
reach that aspect of soft endurance and tranquilly
expectant fear. At fifteen, when I best
remember her, she was a tall girl with a very
grave face when alone, which could break out
with astonishing ease into great smiles of greeting
and then laughter of the whole soul and
body as she was lured to one group or another
in the yard. She mixed so roughly and carelessly
with every one that, at first, I, who had
false picture-book notions of beauty and looked
for it to have something proud and ceremonious
in itself and its reception, did not see how
beautiful she was. She took no care of her
dress, and this made all the more noticeable the
radiant sweetness of her complexion. But I
recognised her beauty before long. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Saturday night she was shopping with Ann,
and I met her suddenly face to face amidst a
pale crowd all spattered with acute light and
shadow from the shops. I did not know who it
was, though I knew Ann. She was so extraordinary
that I stared hard at her as people
do at a foreigner, or a picture, or an animal,
not expecting a look in answer. Others also
were staring, some of the women were laughing.
There could be no greater testimony to beauty
than this laughter of the vulgar. The vulgar
always laugh at beauty; that they did so is
my only reason for calling these women by
that hateful name. Jessie did not heed them.
Then she caught sight of me, and her face
lightened and blossomed with smiles. I shall
not forget it, and how I blushed to be so saluted
in that vile street. There was another reason
why I should remember. Some of the big boys
and young men&mdash;boys just leaving the Grammar
School or in their first year at an office&mdash;winked
at her as they passed; and one of them, a
white-faced youth with a cigarette, not only
winked but grinned as if he were certain of
conquest. Jessie’s face recovered its grave look,
she gave Ann her basket, and at the fullness of
his leer she struck him in the mouth with all her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
force, splashing her small hand and his face
with blood. I trembled and winced with
admiration. Jessie burst into tears. The
crowd was quiet and excited. Everybody
seemed to be looking for somebody else to do
they could not tell what. The crush increased.
I saw Ann wiping Jessie’s hand. They were
saved by a big red-faced working woman, who
had a little husband alongside of her. She
pushed very slowly but with great determination
through the crowd, using her husband
rather as an addition to her weight than as a
brother in arms, until she came to the cluster
of moody youths. Between us and them she
stood, and hammering in her words with a
projecting chin, told them to “Get home, you
chalk-faced quill-drivers, and tell your mothers
to suckle you again on milk instead of water.
Then you can ask leave to look at girls, but not
the likes of this beautiful dear, not you. Get
home....” They laughed awkwardly and
with affected scorn as they turned away from
that face on fire; and it was laughing thus that
they realised that they were blocking the traffic,
and therefore dispersed muttering a sort of
threats, the woman keeping up her attack until
it could not be hoped that they heard her. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
we hurried home we were hooted by similar
boys and by some of the young women who
matched them.</p>

<p>We were proud of Jessie in this attitude,
which made her father call her “Brynhild” or
“Boadicea.” When she was with her mother
she was “Cordelia:” when she nursed a cat or
fed the pigeons she was “Phyllis,” by which I
suppose he meant to express her gentleness.
From that Saturday night I admired everything
about her, down to her bright teeth, which were
a little uneven, and thus gave a touch of country
homeliness to her beauty. Very few girls came
to Abercorran House to see Jessie, partly
because she was impatient of very girlish girls,
partly because they could not get on with her
brothers. And so, with all her sweet temper&mdash;and
violence that came like a tenth wave&mdash;she
was rather alone; just as her face dropped
back to gravity so completely after laughter,
so I think she returned to solitude very easily
after her romps. Was it the shadow of London
upon her, or of her mother’s room? She went
back to Wales too seldom, and as for other
holidays, the charming sophisticated home-counties
were nothing to the Morgans, nor the
seaside resorts. Jessie should have had a purer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
air, where perhaps she would never have sung
the song beginning, “O the cuckoo, she’s a
pretty bird,” and ending with the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, the cuckoo, she’s a pretty bird, she singeth as she flies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bringeth good tidings, she telleth no lies.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes she was willing to sing all three
verses and repeat the first to make a fourth
and to please herself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, the cuckoo, she’s a pretty bird, she singeth as she flies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bringeth good tidings, she telleth no lies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She sucketh sweet flowers, for to keep her voice clear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the more she singeth cuckoo, the summer draweth near.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she came to those last two lines I
looked at her very hard, inspired by the thought
that it was she had sucked dew out of the white
flowers of April, the cuckoo-flower, the stitchwort,
the blackthorn, and the first may, to make
her voice clear and her lips sweet. While she
sang it once Mr Stodham&mdash;a clerk somewhere
who had seen a naked Dryad&mdash;bent his head
a little to one side, perfectly motionless, the
eyes and lips puckered to a perfect attention,
at once eager and passive, so that I think the
melody ran through all his nerves and his veins,
as I am sure he was inviting it to do. I heard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
him telling Mr Morgan afterwards that he wanted
to cry, but could not, it was not in his family.</p>

<p>That was in Mr Morgan’s own room, the
library, the largest room in the house, where
Mr Stodham had gone to escape the boys for
a time. When Mr Morgan was not at the top
of the steps which led down to the yard, smoking
a cigar and watching the boys, the dogs, and
the pigeons, and looking round now and then
to see if Jessie would come, he was in the library
sitting by the big fire with a cigar and a book.
If anyone entered he put the book on his knee,
shifted the cigar to the middle of his mouth,
removed his spectacles, and looked at us without
a word. Then with a nod he replaced
book, cigar, and spectacles, and ignored us.
We spoke in whispers or not at all as we coasted
the high book-shelves lining every part of each
wall, except in one corner, where there were
several guns, an ivory-handled whip, and a pair
of skates. The books were on the whole grim
and senatorial. We felt them vaguely&mdash;the
legal, the historical, and the classical tiers&mdash;to
be our accusers and judges. There were also
many sporting books, many novels, plays,
poems, and romances of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old loves and wars for ladies done by many a lord.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>
<p>If we took some of these down they were not
to be read in the library. We laid one on
our knees, opened a page, but glanced up more
than once the while at Mr Morgan, and then
either replaced it or put it under an arm and
ran off with it on tiptoe. “Stay if you like,
boys,” said Mr Morgan as we reached the door;
and immediately after, “Shut the door quietly.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>At most gatherings and conversations Mr
Morgan listened in silence, except when appealed
to for a fact or a decision, or when he laughed&mdash;we
often did not know why&mdash;and dropped his
cigar, but caught it in some confusion at his
waist. He was a lean man of moderate height
and very upright, a hawk’s profile, a pointed
brown beard, cheeks weathered and worn, and
the heaviest-lidded eyes possible without deformity.
He stood about with one hand in his
coat pocket, the other holding a newspaper
or an opened book. The dogs loved him and
leaped up at him when he appeared, though he
took small notice of them. When we met him
in the street he always had a slow horseman’s
stride, was wrapped in a long overcoat and
deep in thought, and never saw us or made any
sign. At home, though he was a severe-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
man of grave speech, he accepted the irregularities
and alarums without a murmur, often
with a smile, sometimes, as I have said, with
laughter, but that was a little disconcerting.
It was on questions of sport and natural history
that he was most often asked for a judgment,
which he always gave with an indifferent air and
voice, yet in a very exact and unquestionable
manner. But they were the frankest family
alive, and there was nothing which the elder
boys would not discuss in his presence or refer
to him&mdash;except in the matter of horse-racing.
Jack and Roland, the two eldest sons, betted;
and so, as we all knew, did Mr Morgan; but the
father would not say one word about a horse
or a race, unless it was a classical or curious
one belonging to the past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />


<span class="smaller">THE WILD SWANS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">One day as I was passing the library door with
a pair of swan’s wings belonging to Philip, Mr
Morgan stepped out. The look which he gave
to the wings and to me compelled me to stop,
and he said:</p>

<p>“You have a pair of wild swans there,
Arthur.”</p>

<p>I said I had.</p>

<p>“Swan’s wings,” he repeated. “Swan’s wings;”
and as he uttered the words his body relaxed
more than ordinary, until the middle of his back
was supported against the wall, his feet and face
stuck out towards me.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” said he, “that some women
had swan’s wings with which to fly?”</p>

<p>Now I had heard of swan maidens, but he
distinctly said “women,” and the tone of his
voice made me feel that he was not referring to
the flimsy, incredible creatures of fairy tales, but
to women of flesh and blood, of human stature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and nature, such women as might come into the
library and stand by Mr Morgan’s fire&mdash;only,
so far as I knew, no women ever did. So I said
“No.”</p>

<p>“They have,” said he, “or they had in the
young days of Elias Griffiths, who was an old
man when I was a lad.”</p>

<p>Here he sighed and paused, but apologised,
though not exactly to me, by saying: “But
that”&mdash;meaning, I suppose, the sigh&mdash;“is
neither here nor there. Besides, I must not
trespass in Mr Stodham’s province.” For Mr
Stodham was then passing, and I made way for
him.</p>

<p>Mr Morgan continued:</p>

<p>“It was on a Thursday....”</p>

<p>Now I held Mr Morgan in great respect, but
the mention of Thursday at the opening of a
story about swan maidens was too much for me.</p>

<p>“Why Thursday?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I agree with the boy,” remarked Mr Stodham,
leaving us and the talk of swan maidens and
Thursday.</p>

<p>Thursday was a poor sort of a day. Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, were all noticeable days in
some way, though not equally likeable. Friday,
too, as, ushering in Saturday and the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
week, had some merit. Wednesday, again, was
a half holiday. But least of all was to be said
for Thursday. Mr Morgan’s answer was:</p>

<p>“I said it was on a Thursday, because it was
on a Thursday and not on any other day. I am
sorry to see that the indolent spirit of criticism
has resorted to you. Pluck it out, my boy....
Give me those wings.... They are beautiful:
I expect the ferryman shot the swans in the
estuary at Abercorran.... However, they are
not large enough....”</p>

<p>He was looking carefully at the wings, thinking
things which he could not say to me, and I said
nothing. Then, handing me back the wings, he
went on:</p>

<p>“It was on a Thursday, a very stormy one in
December, that two young men who lived with
their old mothers a mile or two inland went down
to the rocks to shoot with their long, ancient
guns. They shot some trash. But the wind
for the most part snatched the birds from the
shot or the shot from the birds, and they could
not hold their guns still for cold. They continued
however, to walk in and out among the rocks,
looking for something to prevent them saving
their gunpowder. But they saw nothing more
until they were close to a creek that runs up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
into the cliff and stops you unless you have wings.
So there they stopped and would have turned
back, if one of them had not gone to the very
edge of the creek wall and looked down. He
levelled his gun instantly, and then dropped it
again. His companion coming up did the same.
Two white swans&mdash;not gray ones like this&mdash;were
just alighting upon the sand below, and before
the eyes of the young men they proceeded to
lay aside their wings and entered the water, not
as swans, but as women, upon that stormy
Thursday. They were women with long black
hair, beautiful white faces and&mdash;Have you seen
the statues at the Museum, my boy? Yes,
you have; and you never thought that there
was anything like them outside of marble. But
there is. These women were like them, and they
were not of marble, any more than they were of
what I am made of.” His own skin was coloured
apparently by a mixture of weather and cigar
smoke. “These women were white, like the
moon when it is neither green nor white. Now
those young men were poor and rough, and they
were unmarried. They watched the women
swimming and diving and floating as if they had
been born in the sea. But as it began to darken
and the swimmers showed no signs of tiring, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
young men made their way down to the swans’
wings to carry them off. No sooner had they
picked up the wings than the two women hastened
towards them into the shallow water, crying out
something in their own tongue which the men
could not even hear for the roar of winds and
waters. As the women drew nearer, the men
retreated a little, holding the wings behind them,
but keeping their eyes fixed on the women.
When the women actually left the water the
men turned and made for home, followed by
the owners of the wings. They reached their
cottages in darkness, barred the doors, and put
away the wings.</p>

<p>But the wingless ones knocked at the doors,
and cried out until the old mothers heard them.
Then the sons told their tale. Their mothers
were very wise. Fumbling to the bottom of
their chests they found clothes suitable for young
women and brides, and they opened their doors.
They quieted the women with clothes for wings,
and though they were very old they could see
that the creatures were beautiful as their sons
had said. They took care that the wings were
not discovered.</p>

<p>Those young men married their guests, and
the pairs lived happily. The sons were proud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
of their wives, who were as obedient as they were
beautiful. Said the old women: Anybody might
think they still had their wings by their lightsome
way of walking. They made no attempt to get
away from the cottages and the smell of bacon.
In fact, they were laughed at by the neighbours
for their home-keeping ways; they never cared
to stay long or far from home, or to see much of
the other women. When they began to have
children they were worse than ever, hardly ever
leaving the house and never parting from their
children. They got thin as well as pale; a
stranger could hardly have told that they were
not human, except for the cold, greenish light
about them and their gait which was like the
swimming of swans.</p>

<p>In course of time the old women died, having
warned their sons not to let their wives on any
account have the wings back. The swan-women
grew paler and yet more thin. One of them,
evidently in a decline, had at length to take
to her bed. Here for the first time she spoke
of her wings. She begged to be allowed to have
them back, because wearing them, she said,
she would certainly not die. She cried bitterly
for the wings, but in vain. On her deathbed
she still cried for them, and took no notice of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
minister’s conversation, so that he, in the hope
of gaining peace and a hearing, advised her
husband to give way to her. He consented.
The wings were taken out of the chest where
they had been exchanged for a wedding garment
years before; they were as white and unruffled
as when they lay upon the sand. At the sight
of them the sick woman stood up in her bed with
a small, wild cry. The wings seemed to fill the
room with white waves; they swept the rush-light
away as they carried the swan out into the
wind. All the village heard her flying low above
the roofs towards the sea, where a fisherman
saw her already high above the cliffs. It was
the last time she was seen.</p>

<p>The other swan-wife lingered for a year or
two. A sister of her husband’s kept house in her
place. Whether this woman had not heard the
story or did not believe it, I do not know. One
day, however, she discovered the wings and gave
them to the children to play with. As one child
came in soon afterwards crying for his mother
and the wings at the same time, it was certain
that she also had taken flight to some place more
suitable for wild swans. They say that two
generations of children of these families were
famous for the same beautiful walking as their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
mothers, whom they never saw again....” Here
Mr Morgan paused for a moment then added:
“I wonder why we never hear of swan-men?”</p>

<p>I was not much impressed at the time by
the story and his dry way of telling it. What I
liked most was the idea that two ordinary men
went shooting on a Thursday in mid-winter and
caught swan-maidens bathing in a pool on the
Welsh coast and married them. So I said to
Mr Morgan:</p>

<p>“Why did you ever leave Wales, Mr
Morgan?”</p>

<p>He put a new cigar severely between his teeth
and looked at me as if he did not know or even
see me. I ran off with the wings to Philip.</p>

<p class="noindent">I alone was listening to the swan story, but it
would have been more in accordance with the
custom of the house if it had been told in a large
company out in the yard&mdash;in one of the bedrooms&mdash;in
the library itself&mdash;or in the dining-room
(where there was a vast sideboard bearing a
joint, cheese, bread, fruit, cakes, and bottles of
ale, to which the boys or the visitors resorted,
for meals without a name, at all hours of the day).
Most often the yard and the steps leading down
to it were the meeting-place. The pigeons, the
conservatory, with its bicycles, a lathe and all
sorts of beginnings and remains, the dogs, above
all the sun and the view of the Wilderness,
attracted everyone to the yard as a common
centre for the Morgans and those who gathered
round one or other of them. Thus, for example,
the pigeons did not belong to the Morgans at all,
but to one Higgs, who was unable to keep them at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
his home. He was always in and out of the yard,
frequently bringing friends who might or might
not become friends of the family. Everyone
was free to look at the pigeons, note which had
laid and which had hatched, to use the lathe, to
take the dogs out if they were willing, to go
upstairs and see the wonders&mdash;the eggs of kites,
ravens, buzzards, curlews, for example, taken
by Jack and Roland near Abercorran&mdash;and to
have a meal at the sideboard or a cup of tea
from one of Ann’s brews in the kitchen.

Jack and Roland in themselves attracted a
large and mixed company. Jack, the eldest,
was a huge, brown-haired, good-natured fellow,
with his father’s eyes, or rather eyelids. He
was very strong, and knew all about dogs and
horses. He was a good deal away from the
house, we did not know where, except that it was
not at an office or other place where they work.
Roland was tall, black-haired, dark-eyed like his
mother, and as strong as Jack. He was handsome
and proud-looking, but though quick-tempered
was not proud in speech with us
lesser ones. His learning was equal to Jack’s,
and it comprised also the theatre; he was
dressed as carefully as Jack was carelessly, but
like Jack would allow the pigeons to perch any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>where
upon him. Both wore knickerbockers
and looked like country gentlemen in exile.
Jack smoked a clay pipe, Roland cigarettes.
They were very good friends. Though they
did no work, one or other of them was often at
the lathe. They boxed together while we stood
round, admiring Jack because he could never
be beaten, and Roland because no one but his
brother could have resisted him. They were
sometimes to be seen looking extremely serious
over a sporting paper. Lewis and Harry were a
similar pair many years younger, Lewis, the elder,
broader, shorter, and fairer of the two, both of
them stiff and straight like their elders. They
also had begun to acquire trains of adherents
from the various schools which they had irregularly
and with long intervals attended. They
treated the streets like woods, and never complained
of the substitute. Once or twice a year
they went to a barber to have their black
and brown manes transformed into a uniform
stubble of less than half an inch. Midway
between these two pairs came Philip, and a
little after him Jessie.</p>

<p>These six attracted every energetic or discontented
boy in the neighbourhood. Abercorran
House was as good as a mountain or a sea-shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
for them, and was accessible at any hour of the
day or night, “except at breakfast time,” said
Mr Stodham&mdash;for there was no breakfast-time.
Mr Stodham was a middle-aged refugee at
Abercorran House, one for whom breakfast had
become the most austere meal of the day, to be
taken with a perfectly adjusted system of times
and ceremonies, in silence, far from children and
from all innovation, irregularity, and disorder.
Therefore the house of the Morgans was for him
the house that had no breakfast-time, and unconsciously
he was seeking salvation in the
anarchy which at home would have been unendurable.
Mr Stodham was not the only
client who was no longer a boy, but he and
the few others were all late converts; for, as
I have mentioned, boys forsook Abercorran
House as they grew up. Parents, too, looked
foul-favouredly on the house. The family was
irregular, not respectable, mysterious, in short
unprofitable. It may have got about that when
Mr Morgan once received a fountain-pen as a gift,
he said he did not want any of “your damned
time-saving appliances.” Of course, said he,
some people could not help saving time and
money&mdash;let them&mdash;they were never clever enough
to know what to do with them, supposing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
their savings were not hidden out of their reach
like their childhood&mdash;but it had not occurred to
him to do either, so he gave the pen to the little
milk-boy, advising him to give it away before it
got a hold on him. This child had delighted
Mr Morgan by coming up the street every day,
singing a filthy song. It was a test of innocence,
whether the words of it did or did not make the
hearer wish that either he or the singer might
sink instantaneously into the earth. Mr Morgan
did not like the song at all. The words were in
no way better than those of a bad hymn, nor
was the tune. But he liked what he called the
boy’s innocence. Ophelia only sang “By Gis
and by Saint Charity” under cover of madness.
At the worst this boy made no pretence. Mr
Morgan argued, probably, that one who had
such thoughts would not have the impudence
to sing so except to a select audience; he had
no doubt of this when the boy sang it once on
being asked to in the Library. I do not know
what happened, beyond this, that Mr Morgan
looked as if he had been crying, and the boy
never sang it again. If this got about, few
could think any better of the Morgans at Abercorran
House. Moreover, the window frames and
doors were never painted, and the front gate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
remained upright only because it was never
closed; and on any sunny day a man passing
down the lane was sure of hearing men and
boys laughing, or Jessie singing, and dogs
barking or yawning, pigeons courting, over the
fence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">AURELIUS, THE SUPERFLUOUS MAN</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">We recalled many memories, Ann and I, as we
stood in the empty and silent, but still sunlit
yard, on my last visit. At one moment the
past seemed everything, the present a dream;
at another, the past seemed to have gone for
ever. Trying, I suppose, to make myself believe
that there had been no break, but only a
gradual change, I asked Ann if things at Abercorran
House had not been quieter for some
time past.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said she, “there was always someone
new dropping in, and you know nobody
came twice without coming a hundred times.
We had the little Morgans of Clare’s Castle here
for more than a year, and almost crowded us
out with friends. Then Mr&mdash;whatever was his
name&mdash;the Italian&mdash;I mean the Gypsy&mdash;Mr
Aurelius&mdash;stayed here three times for months
on end, and that brought quite little children.”</p>

<p>“Of course it did, Ann. Aurelius.... Don’t I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
remember what he was&mdash;can it be fifteen years
ago? He was the first man I ever met who
really proved that man is above the other
animals <i>as an animal</i>. He was really better
than any pony, or hound, or bird of prey, in
their own way.”</p>

<p>“Now you are <i>talking</i>, Mr Froxfield&mdash;Arthur,
I <i>should</i> say.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am, but Aurelius makes you
talk. I remember him up in the Library reading
that Arabian tale about the great king who
had a hundred thousand kings under him, and
what he liked most was to read in old books
about Paradise and its wonders and loveliness.
I remember Aurelius saying: And when he
came upon a certain description of Paradise, its
pavilions and lofty chambers and precious-laden
trees, and a thousand beautiful and
strange things, he fell into a rapture so that he
determined to make its equal on earth.”</p>

<p>“He is the first rich man I ever heard of that
had so much sense,” said Ann. “Perhaps Aurelius
would have done like that if he had been as
rich as sin, instead of owing a wine-and-spirit
merchant four and six and being owed half-a-crown
by me. But he does not need it now,
that is, so far as we can tell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“What, Ann, is Aurelius dead?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot say. But we shall never
see him again.”</p>

<p>“Why frighten me for nothing? Of course
he will turn up: he always did.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He promised Mr Torrance he would write
and wait for an answer every Midsummer day,
if not oftener, wherever he might be. He has
now missed two Midsummers, which he would
not do&mdash;you know he could not do such a thing
to Mr Torrance&mdash;if he was in his right mind.
He wasn’t young, and perhaps he had to pay
for keeping his young looks so long.”</p>

<p>“Why? How old could he be?” I said
quickly, forgetting how long ago it was that I
met him first.</p>

<p>“I know he is fifty,” said Ann.</p>

<p>I did not answer because it seemed ridiculous
and I did not want to be rude to Ann. I should
have said a moment before, had I been asked,
that he was thirty. But Ann was right.</p>

<p>“Where was he last heard of, Ann?”</p>

<p>“I went myself with little Henry Morgan
and Jessie to a place called Oatham, or something
like it, where he last wrote from. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
been an under-gardener there for nearly two
years, and we saw the man and his wife who let
him a room and looked after him. They said
he seemed to be well-off, and of course he would.
You know he ate little, smoked and drank
nothing, and gave nothing to any known charities.
They remembered him very well because he
taught them to play cards and was very clean
and very silent. ‘As clean as a lady,’ she
said to Jessie, who only said, ‘Cleaner.’ You
know her way. The man did not like him, I
know. He said Aurelius used to sit as quiet as
a book and never complained of anything. ‘He
never ate half he paid for, I will say that,’ said
he. ‘He was too fond of flowers, too, for an
under-gardener, and used to ask why daisies
and fluellen and such-like were called weeds.
There was something wrong with him, something
on his conscience perhaps.’ The squire’s agent,
a Mr Theobald, said the same when he came
in. He thought there was something wrong.
He said such people were unnecessary. Nothing
could be done with them. They were no better
than wild birds compared with pheasants, even
when they could sing, which some of them
could do, but not Aurelius. They caused a
great deal of trouble, said my lord the agent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of my lord the squire, yet you couldn’t put them
out of the way. He remarked that Aurelius
never wrote any letters and never received any&mdash;that
looked bad, too. ‘What we want,’ said
he&mdash;‘is a little less Theobald,’ said Jessie, but
the man didn’t notice her. ‘What we want is
efficiency. How are we to get it with the likes
of this Mr What’s-his-name in the way? They
neither produce like the poor nor consume like
the rich, and it is by production and consumption
that the world goes round, I say. He was
a bit of a poacher, too. I caught him myself
letting a hare out of a snare&mdash;letting it out, so
he said. I said nothing to the squire, but the
chap had to go.’ And that’s all we shall hear
about Aurelius,” said Ann. “He left there in
the muck of February. They didn’t know
where he was going, and didn’t care, though he
provided them with gossip for a year to come.
The woman asked me how old he was. Before
I could have answered, her husband said:
‘About thirty I should say.’ The woman
could not resist saying snappily: ‘Fifty’....”</p>

<p>Aurelius was gone, then. It cannot have
surprised anyone. What was surprising was
the way he used to reappear after long absences.
While he was present everyone liked him, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
he had something unreal about him or not like
a man of this world. When that squire’s agent
called his under-gardener a superfluous man,
he was a brute and he was wrong, but he saw
straight. If we accept his label there must
always have been some superfluous men since
the beginning, men whom the extravagant
ingenuity of creation has produced out of sheer
delight in variety, by-products of its immense
processes. Sometimes I think it was some of
these superfluous men who invented God and
all the gods and godlets. Some of them have
been killed, some enthroned, some sainted,
for it. But in a civilisation like ours the superfluous
abound and even flourish. They are
born in palace and cottage and under hedges.
Often they are fortunate in being called mad
from early years; sometimes they live a brief,
charmed life without toil, envied almost as
much as the animals by drudges; sometimes
they are no more than delicate instruments
on which men play melodies of agony and
sweetness.</p>

<p>The superfluous are those who cannot find
society with which they are in some sort of
harmony. The magic circle drawn round us
all at birth surrounds these in such a way that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
it will never overlap, far less become concentric
with, the circles of any other in the whirling
multitudes. The circle is a high wall guarded
as if it were a Paradise, not a Hell, “with
dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms”: or it
is no more than a shell border round the garden
of a child, and there is no one so feeble but he
can slip over it, or shift it, or trample it down,
though powerless to remove it. Some of these
weaker ones might seem to have several circles
enclosing them, which are thus upset or trampled
one by one as childhood advances. Everybody
discovers that he can cross their borders. They
do not retaliate. These are the superfluous
who are kept alive to perform the most terrible
or most loathsome tasks. Rarely do their
tyrants see their eyes gleaming in their dungeons,
and draw back or hurl a stone like a man who
has almost trodden upon a fox.</p>

<p>But the superfluous are not always unfortunate;
we who knew Aurelius would never call
him unfortunate. There are some&mdash;and more
than ever in these days when even the strongest
do not condemn outright, and when deaths less
unpleasant to the executioner have been discovered&mdash;some
who escape the necessity to toil
and spin for others, and do not spend their ease<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
in manacles. Many of the women among the
hunted are not slaughtered as soon as caught.
They are kept in artfully constructed and choicely
decorated cages where their captors try to force
them to sing over and over again the notes
which were their allurement at first; a few
survive to wear white locks and trouble with a
new note the serenity of the palaces where their
cages are suspended. The superfluous have
been known to learn the ways of their superiors,
to make little camps unmolested in the midst
of the foreign land, to enjoy a life admired of
many and sometimes envied, but insincerely.</p>

<p>Some of the captives enslave their masters.
Aurelius was one. From my earliest days
Aurelius and rumours of him were much about
me. Once he earned his bread in a great country
house by looking after the books and writing
letters. They lodged, fed, and clothed him,
and gave him a small wage&mdash;he came from no
one knew where, except that it must have been
a gutter or a ditch, as he said, “between the
moon and Mercury.” But he would tell children
that he was begotten out of the moonlight by
an owl’s hooting, or that he was born in a tent
in the New Forest, where there were more leaves
than money. It was a sort of grievance against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
him that he could always buy what he wanted,
as a book for himself or a toy for a child.</p>

<p>He can have been of little use as a letter-writer,
as I see now. His writing looked as
unfamiliar as Persian, and must have been
laborious. It was suited to the copying of
incantations, horoscopes, receipts for confectionery.
It must often have startled the reader
like a line of trees or flight of birds writing
their black legend on the dawn silver. There
was nothing in the meaning of his sentences,
I think, to correspond with the looks of them.
A few of his letters survive, and some notes on
accessions to the library, etc.; but it is clear
that they were written in a language foreign
to the man, a loose journalistic English of the
moment, neither classic nor colloquial, and they
have no significance.</p>

<p>Some people called him a little man, but in
his size as in other things he seemed rather
to be of another species than a diminutive
example of our own. He was smaller than a
man, but not unpleasantly small, neither were
his hands too long and delicate, nor were they
incapable of a man’s work. In every way he
was finely made and graceful, with clear large
features, curled dark-brown hair and beard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
almost auburn. His clothes were part of him,
of a lighter brown than his hair and of some
substance which was more like a natural fur
than a made cloth. These clothes, along with
his voice, which was very deep, his hair, and his
silent movements, increased his pleasing inhumanity.
He sat among many people and
said trivial things, or more often nothing,
looking very far away and very little, turning
all light somehow to moonlight, his dark eyes
full of subdued gleaming; and both speech and
silence drew upon him an attention which gave
the casual observer an excuse for calling him
vain. Children liked him, though he never
troubled to show a liking for children, and while
we sat on his lap or displayed a book for him
he would be talking busily to others, but without
offending us. He did not often tell us
tales or play games with us, but he had a swift,
gentle way of putting his hand on our heads
and looking at us which always seemed an
honour.</p>

<p>I recall chiefly, in connection with Aurelius,
an evening near the end of winter at the great
house. There had been a week of frost, some
days silent and misty, others loud and clear
with a north-east wind. Then came the west<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
wind, a day’s balmy sun, and at last rain. This
day I recall was the next. It was full of goings
to and fro of loose cloud, of yellow threatenings
on the hills. The light was thin and pale,
falling tenderly over green fields and their fresh
sprinkling of mole-heaps. But the rain would
not descend, and as we got to the big house for
tea the sky cleared, and in the twilight blackbirds
were chinking nervously before sleep and
now and then hurrying across the dim grass
between the dark hedges and copses. A robin
sang at the edge of a holly, and a thrush somewhere
remote, and the world had become narrow
and homely, the birds sounded secure like
happily tired boys lazily undressing, and evidently
they did not expect men. Three-quarters
of a moon hung at the zenith, cold and fresh
and white like an early spring flower. We
grew silent, but at tea were particularly noisy
and excited, too excited and near to tears, when
I rushed upstairs. In the library I found
Aurelius reading, with his back to the uncurtained
window, by a light that only illuminated
his face and page. Running at first to the
window, I pressed my face on the pane to see
the profound of deepening night, and the lake
shining dimly like a window through which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the things under the earth might be seen if you
were out. The abyss of solitude below and
around was swallowing the little white moon
and might swallow me also; with terror at
this feeling I turned away. “What?” said
Aurelius, without even looking round, but apparently
aware of my feeling. Seated in his lap,
he took hardly more notice of me, but I was
comforted. His silence was not a mere absence
of words. It was not the peevish silence of one
too cautious or too fearful to speak; nor the
silence of one who has suddenly become isolated
and feels it, yet cannot escape. Up out of the
silence rose the voice of Aurelius reading out
of the book before him. Over my shoulder
came the rustling of ivy, and the sighing of
trees, and the running of the brook through the
coomb; the moon, close at hand, out in the
black garden, pressed her face against the
window and looked in at me. Aurelius was
reading of that great king who had under him a
hundred thousand kings, and whose chief delight
was in ancient books telling of the loveliness of
Paradise: “And when he met with this description
of the world to come, and of Paradise and
its pavilions, its lofty chambers, its trees and
fruits, and of the other things in Paradise, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
heart enticed him to construct its like on
earth....” The world extended to a vastness
that came close up to me and enfolded me as a
lake enfolds one swan. Thus at the building of
that Paradise I easily imagined doorways that
would have admitted Orion and the Pleiades
together. And at last, at the cry of destruction,
though I was sorry, I was intensely satisfied
with both the sadness and the splendour. I
began to dream in the following silence. I
dreamed I was lying at the edge of an immense
sea, upon a rock scarcely raised above the
water of the colour of sapphires. I saw go by
me a procession of enormous seals whose backs
swelled out of the wavelets like camels, and
as they passed in deep water, a few yards away,
each one cast on me his dark soft eyes, and
they were the eyes of Aurelius. There were
more coming behind when I awoke. Aurelius
lighted another lamp. I went over again to
the window and looked out. In a flash I saw
the outer vast world of solitude, darkness, and
silence, waiting eternally for its prey, and felt
behind me the little world within that darkness
like a lighthouse. I went back to the others.
Aurelius for all I knew went to the kingdoms
of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Many times again he read to us after I had on
some pretext brought him to Abercorran House,
a year or two later.</p>

<p>Yet older people said that Aurelius had no
perception of religion, or beauty, or human
suffering. Certainly he talked of these things,
as I see now, with a strange and callous-seeming
familiarity, as a poultry-farmer talks of chickens;
but our elders did not explain it when they called
it in scorn artistic. I suspect it was in scorn,
though they said it was to humanise him, that
they helped to get him married to a “nice
sensible” girl who never came near Abercorran
House. Like many other women, she had been
used to petting him as if he were an animal.
He responded with quaint, elaborate speeches
and gestures, kneeling to speak, calling her by
different invented names, but perhaps with a
mock-heroic humorous gleam. He married her,
and all I know is that he slipped away from
the charming flat where the kindness of friends
had deposited them, and never reappeared in
the neighbourhood except at Abercorran House.
He sent her money from time to time which
he earned as trainer to a troupe of dogs in a
travelling circus, as a waiter, as a commercial
traveller of some sort. It was said that he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
been to sea. In any case, to hear him sing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Along the plains of Mexico”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">was better than sailing in any ship we had ever
been in or imagined. I am sure that he could
not have improved his singing of “Along the
Plains of Mexico” by sailing from Swansea
to Ilfracombe or round Cape Horn, or by getting
a heart of oak and a hand of iron. He brought
nothing back with him from his travels. He
had no possessions&mdash;not a book, not a watch,
not an extra suit of clothes, not a lead pencil.
He could live on nothing, and at times, it was
said, had done so. For his hardiness was great,
and habitually he ate almost nothing. Man,
God, and weather could not harm him. Of
course he was sometimes put upon, for he would
not quarrel. For having treated him better
than he appeared to have expected, some people
could hardly forgive themselves until they
learned to take it as creditable. One tremendous
tradesman, for instance, explained his comparative
civility to Aurelius on a trying occasion
by blustering: “You never know where you
are with these Gypsies:” he came, however, to
regard himself as a benefactor. A minister of
the gospel who was tricked by Aurelius’ innocence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
had to fall back on accusing him of concealing
his age and of being a Welshman. Everyone
thought him a foreigner.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable thing that nobody except
a few children and Mr Torrance the schoolmaster&mdash;for
actually one schoolmaster frequented
Abercorran House&mdash;liked to be alone with
Aurelius. I never heard this spoken of, and I
believe nobody consciously avoided being alone
with him. Only, it so happened that he was
welcomed by a company, but not one member
of it was likely to stay on long if at last he
found himself and Aurelius left behind by the
others. Meeting him in the street, no one ever
stopped for more than a few words with him.
Some awkwardness was feared, but not in
Aurelius, who was never awkward. Unsympathetic
people called him a foreigner, and there
was something in it. In no imaginable crowd
could he have been one of the million “friends,
Romans, countrymen!” Perhaps even at Abercorran
House he was not quite one of us. Yet
in a moment he was at home there. I can see
him holding a pigeon&mdash;in the correct manner&mdash;spreading
out one of its wings and letting it
slip back again, while he was talking, as luck
would have it, to Higgs the bird-chap who cared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
for nothing but pigeons. Higgs was so taken
aback by the way the new-comer talked and
held the bird&mdash;a man whom he would instinctively
have laughed at&mdash;that he could not say
a word, but escaped as soon as possible and
blundered about saying: “I like the little
chap.... You can see he’s used to birds&mdash;who
would have thought it?&mdash;and I wondered
what it was young Arthur was bringing in.”
Higgs was so pleased with his own discernment,
his cleverness in seeing good in that unlikely
place, that he really exaggerated his liking for
Aurelius. However, let it be set down to
Higgs’ credit that he knew a hawk from a
handsaw, and hailed Aurelius almost at first
sight.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, Aurelius had asked
me to take him to Abercorran House, because
I had attracted his fancy with something I
had said about the Morgans or the house. It
was a lucky introduction. For all liked him,
and he was soon free to stay at the house for
a night or a month, at pleasure. It was one of
his virtues to admire Jessie. He must have
felt at once that she was alone among women,
since he never knelt to her or made any of his
long, lofty speeches to her as to other fair women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
whom he met elsewhere, as at my home. She
saw his merit instantly. To please him she
would go on and on singing for him “The
Cuckoo,” “Midsummer Maid,” “Hob-y-deri-dando,”
“Crockamy Daisy Kitty-alone.”</p>

<p>When for a time he was a bookseller’s assistant
in London, it was Jessie discovered him, as she
was passing with her mother at night. She
said he was standing outside like one of those
young men in “The Arabian Nights” who open
a stall in a market at Bagdad because they
hope to capture someone long-lost or much-desired
among their customers. But he soon
wearied of dry goods, and was not seen after
that for over a year, though Mr Torrance brought
word that he had written from Dean Prior in
Devonshire, where (he said) a great poet lived
who would have been sorry to die in 1674 if he
had known he was going to miss Aurelius by
doing so. Which may be absurd, but Mr
Torrance said it, and he knew both Herrick and
Aurelius extremely well. He did try to explain
the likeness, but to an audience that only knew
Herrick as the author of “Bid me to live” and
as an immoral clergyman, and at this distance of
time I cannot reconstruct the likeness. But it
may have been that Aurelius wrote verses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
which Mr Torrance, in the kindness of his heart,
believed to resemble Herrick’s. I know nothing
of that. The nearest to poetry I ever saw of
his was a pack of cards which he spent his life,
off and on, in painting. Jessie was one of the
Queens, and rightly so. That this pack was
found in the cottage where he stayed before he
finally disappeared, proves, to me at any rate,
that he regarded this life as at an end.</p>

<p class="noindent">“It was a good day, Arthur, that first brought
you to Abercorran House,” said old Ann, as she
went to the door to deliver the stray pigeon to
its owner.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, a little pathetically for Ann’s
taste and with thought too deep for tears, at
least in her company. I looked round the
kitchen, remembering the glory that was Abercorran
... Philip ... Jessie ... Roland ...
Aurelius.... It was no unselfish memory, for
I wished with all my heart that I was fifteen
again, that the month was April, the hour noon,
and the scene the yard of Abercorran House with
all the family assembled, all the dogs, Aurelius,
and Mr Torrance (there being still some days left
of the Easter holidays), yes, and Higgs also, and
most certainly the respectable Mr Stodham.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a good day,” continued Ann,
returning, “if it had not been for you we should
never have known Aurelius.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>This was so like the old Ann that I was delighted,
with all my conceit. I remembered that
first visit well, limping into the yard the day
after the paper-chase, and seeing big Jack (aged
then about twenty) and tall Roland (less than
two years younger) discussing a greyhound with
a blackguard in an orange neck-tie, Jessie (my
own age) surrounded by pigeons, Mr Morgan and
Mr Torrance at the top of the steps looking on,
and away on the pond under the elms little
Harry and Lewis crying for help to release their
craft from the water-lilies of that perilous sea.
When the limper was introduced as “Arthur,”
Mr Torrance said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not that same Arthur, that with spear in rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shot through the lists at Camelot and charged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the eyes of ladies and of kings,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Mr Morgan roared with laughter, as having
no cigar he was free to do at the moment, and
everyone else joined in except the Gypsy, who
appeared to think he was the victim; such
laughter was a command. Before the roar was
over Ann came up to me and said: “Will you
please to come into the kitchen. I have something
for that poor leg of yours.” Pity was
worse than ever, but to escape the laughter, I
followed her. “There you are,” she said as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
entered, pointing to a broad blackberry tart
uncut, “that will do your leg good. It is between
you and Philip.” And with that she left me
and at another door in came Philip, and though
there was nothing wrong with his leg he enjoyed
the tart as much as I did.</p>

<p>We were then friends of twenty-four hours
standing, my age being ten, his twelve, and the
time of the year an October as sweet as its
name. We had been for six months together at
the same school without speaking, until yesterday,
the day of the paper-chase. After running
and walking for more than two hours that sunny
morning we found ourselves together, clean out
of London and also out of the chase, because he
had gone off on a false scent and because I ran
badly.</p>

<p>I had never before been in that lane of larches.
It was, in fact, the first time that I had got out
of London into pure country on foot. I had been
by train to sea-side resorts and the country
homes of relatives, but this was different. I had
no idea that London died in this way into the
wild.</p>

<p>Out on the broad pasture bounded by a copse
like a dark wall, rooks cawed in the oak-trees.
Moorhens hooted on a hidden water behind the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
larches. At the end of a row of cottages and
gardens full of the darkest dahlias was a small,
gray inn called “The George,” which my companion
entered. He came out again in a minute
with bread and cheese for two, and eating slowly
but with large mouthfuls we strolled on, too
busy and too idle to talk. Instead of larches
horse-chestnuts overhung our road; in the
glittering grass borders the dark fruit and the
white pods lay bright. So as we ate we stooped
continually for the biggest “conquers” to fill
our pockets. Suddenly the other boy, musing
and not looking at me, asked, “What’s your
name?” “Arthur Froxfield,” I answered,
pleased and not at all surprised. “It doesn’t
suit you,” he said, looking at me. “It ought
to be John <span class="lock">something&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘John, John, John,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the big boots on.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">You’re tired.”</p>

<p>I knew his name well enough, for at twelve
he was the best runner in the school. Philip
Morgan.... I do not suppose that I concealed
my pride to be thus in his company.</p>

<p>For an hour we were separated; we hit upon
the trail, and off he went without a word. At a
limping trot I followed, but lost sight of Philip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and soon fell back into a walk. I had, in fact,
turned homewards when he overtook me; he
had been forced to retrace his steps. I was by
this time worn out, and should have given up
but for my self-satisfaction at the long run and
the pleasure of knowing that he did not mind
my hanging on his arm as on we crawled. Thus
at last after an age of sleepy fatigue I found
myself at home. It had been arranged that on
the next day I was to go round to Abercorran
House.</p>

<p>Again and again Philip and I revisited that
lane of larches, the long water-side copse, the
oak wood out in the midst of the fields, and all
the hedges, to find moorhen’s eggs, a golden-crested
wren’s, and a thousand treasures, and
felicity itself. Philip had known this country
for a year or more; now we always went together.
I at least, for a long time, had a strong private
belief that the place had been deserted, overlooked,
forgotten, that it was known only to us.
It was not like ordinary country. The sun there
was peculiarly bright. There was something
unusual in the green of its grass, in the caw of
its rooks in April, in the singing of its missel-thrushes
on the little round islands of wood upon
the ploughland. When later on I read about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
those “remote and holy isles” where the three
sons of Ulysses and Circe ruled over the glorious
Tyrrhenians, I thought, for some reason or
another, or perhaps for no reason, of those little
round islands of ash and hazel amidst the
ploughland of Our Country, when I was ten and
Philip twelve. If we left it unvisited for some
weeks it used to appear to our imaginations extraordinary
in its beauty, and though we might be
forming plans to go thither again before long, I
did not fully believe that it existed&mdash;at least for
others&mdash;while I was away from it. I have never
seen thrushes’ eggs of a blue equalling those we
found there.</p>

<p>No wonder Our Country was supernaturally
beautiful. It had London for a foil and background;
what is more, on that first day it wore
an uncommon autumnal splendour, so that I
cannot hope to meet again such heavily gilded
elms smouldering in warm, windless sunshine, nor
such bright meadows as they stood in, nor such
blue sky and such white billowy cloud as rose up
behind the oaks on its horizon.</p>

<p>Philip knew this Our Country in and out, and
though his opinion was that it was not a patch
on the country about his old home at Abercorran,
he was never tired of it. In the first place he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
had been introduced to it by Mr Stodham. “Mr
Stodham,” said Philip, “knows more about
England than the men who write the geography
books. He knows High Bower, where we lived
for a year. He is a nice man. He has a horrible
wife. He is in an office somewhere, and she
spends his money on jewellery. But he does
not mind; remember that. He has written a
poem and father does not want him to recite
it. Glory be to Mr Stodham. When he trespasses
they don’t say anything, or if they do
it is only, ‘Fine day, sir,’ or ‘Where did you
want to go to, sir,’ or ‘Excuse me, sir, I don’t
mind your being on my ground, but thought
you mightn’t be aware it is private.’ But if
they catch you or me, especially you, being only
eleven and peagreen at that, we shall catch it.”</p>

<p>Once he was caught. He was in a little copse
that was all blackthorns, and the blackthorns
were all spikes. Inside was Philip looking for
what he could find; outside, and keeping watch,
sat I; and it was Sunday. Sunday was the
only day when you ever saw anyone in Our
Country. Presently a man who was passing
said: “The farmer’s coming along this road,
if that’s any interest to you.” It was too late.
There he was&mdash;coming round the bend a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
of a mile off, on a white pony. I whistled to
Philip to look out. I was innocently sitting in
the same place when the farmer rode up. He
asked me at once the name of the boy in the
copse, which so took me by surprise that I
blabbed out at once. “Philip Morgan,” shouted
the farmer, “Philip Morgan, come out of that
copse.” But Philip was already out of it, as I
guessed presently when I saw a labourer running
towards the far end, evidently in pursuit. The
farmer rode on, and thinking he had given it up
I followed him. However, five minutes later
Philip ran into his arms at a gateway, just as he
was certain he had escaped, because his pursuer
had been outclassed and had given up running.
In a few minutes I joined them. Philip was
recovering his breath and at the same time giving
his address. If we sent in five shillings to a
certain hospital in his name, said the farmer,
he would not prosecute us&mdash;“No,” he added,
“ten shillings, as it is Sunday.” “The better
the day the better the deed,” said Philip scornfully.
“Thank you, my lad,” said the giver of
charity, and so we parted. But neither did we
pay the money, nor were we prosecuted; for
my father wrote a letter from his official address.
I do not know what he said. In future, naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
we gave some of our time and trouble to avoiding
the white pony when we were in those parts.
Not that he got on our nerves. We had no
nerves. No: but we made a difference. Besides,
his ground was really not in what we called
Our Country, <i>par excellence</i>. Our own country
was so free from molestation that I thought of
it instantly when Aurelius read to me about the
Palace of the Mountain of Clouds. A great
king had asked his counsellors and his companions
if they knew of any place that no one
could invade, no one, either man or genie. They
told him of the Palace of the Mountain of Clouds.
It had been built by a genie who had fled from
Solomon in rebellion. There he had dwelt until
the end of his days. After him no one inhabited
it; for it was separated by great distances and
great enchantment from the rest of the world.
No one went thither. It was surrounded by running
water sweeter than honey, colder than snow,
and by fruitful trees. And there in the Palace
of the Mountain of Clouds the king might dwell in
safety and solitude for ever and ever....</p>

<p>In the middle of the oak wood we felt as safe
and solitary as if we were lords of the Palace
of the Mountain of Clouds. And so we were.
For four years we lived charmed lives. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
example, when we had manufactured a gun and
bought a pistol, we crawled over the ploughed
fields at twilight, and fired both at a flock of
pewits. Yet neither birds nor poachers suffered.
We climbed the trees for the nests of crows,
woodpeckers, owls, wood-pigeons, and once for
a kestrel’s, as if they were all ours. We went
everywhere. More than once we found ourselves
among the lawns and shrubberies of big houses
which we had never suspected. This seems
generally to have happened at twilight. As we
never saw the same house twice the mysteriousness
was increased. One of the houses was a
perfect type of the dark ancient house in a
forest. We came suddenly stumbling upon it
among the oaks just before night. The walls were
high and craggy, and without lights anywhere.
A yew tree grew right up against it. A crow
uttered a curse from the oak wood. And that
house I have never seen again save in memory.
There it remains, as English as Morland, as
extravagantly wild as Salvator Rosa. That
evening Philip must needs twang his crossbow
at the crow&mdash;an impossible shot; but by the
grace of God no one came out of the house, and
at this distance of time it is hard to believe that
men and women were actually living there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Most of these estates had a pond or two, and
one had a long one like a section of a canal.
Here we fished with impunity and an untroubled
heart, hoping for a carp, now and then catching
a tench. But often we did not trouble to go so
far afield. Our own neighbourhood was by no
means unproductive, and the only part of it
which was sacred was the Wilderness. None of
the birds of the Wilderness ever suffered at our
hands. Without thinking about it we refrained
from fishing in the Wilderness pond, and I never
saw anybody else do so except Higgs, but
though it seemed to me like robbing the offertory
Higgs only grinned. But other people’s grounds
were honoured in a different way. Private shrubberies
became romantic at night to the trespasser.
Danger doubled their shadows, and creeping
amongst them we missed no ecstasy of which
we were capable. The danger caused no conscious
anxiety or fear, yet contrived to heighten
the colour of such expeditions. We never had
the least expectation of being caught. Otherwise
we should have had more than a little fear in the
January night when we went out after birds,
armed with nets and lanterns. The scene was
a region of meadows, waiting to be built on and
in the meantime occupied by a few horses and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
cows, and a football and a lawn-tennis club. Up
and down the hedges we went with great hopes
of four and twenty blackbirds or so. We had
attained a deep and thrilling satisfaction but not
taken a single bird when we were suddenly aware
of a deep, genial voice asking, “What’s the
game?” It was a policeman. The sight acted
like the pulling of a trigger&mdash;off we sped.
Having an advantage of position I was the first
to leap the boundary hedge into the road, or
rather into the ditch between hedge and road.
Philip followed, but not the policeman. We
both fell at the jump, Philip landing on top of
me, but without damage to either. We reached
home, covered in mud and secret glory, which
made up for the loss of a cap and two lanterns.
The glory lasted one day only, for on the next
I was compelled to accompany my father to
the police-station to inquire after the cap and
lanterns. However, I had the honour of hearing
the policeman say&mdash;though laughing&mdash;that we
had taken the leap like hunters and given him
no chance at all. This and the fact that our
property was not recovered preserved a little
of the glory.</p>

<p>In these meadows, in the grounds which their
owners never used at night, and in Our Country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Philip and I spent really a great deal of
time, fishing, birds-nesting, and trying to shoot
birds with cross-bow, pistol, or home-made gun.
There were intervals of school, and of football
and cricket, but these in memory do not amount
to more than the towns of England do in comparison
with the country. As on the map the
towns are but blots and spots on the country,
so the school-hours were embedded, almost
buried away, in the holidays, official, semi-official,
and altogether unofficial. Philip and I
were together during most of them; even the
three principal long holidays of the year were
often shared, either in Wales with some of
Philip’s people, or at Lydiard Constantine, in
Wiltshire, with my aunt Rachel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">WOOL-GATHERING AND LYDIARD CONSTANTINE</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">One day at Abercorran House I heard Aurelius,
Mr Morgan, and Mr Torrance in the Library,
talking about wool-gathering. “Since Jessie
told us about that river in Essex with the Welsh
name,” said Mr Morgan, laughing, “we have
travelled from Gwithavon to Battersea Park
Road and a fishmonger’s advertisement. Such
are the operations of the majestic intellect.
How did we get all that way? Do you suppose
the cave-men were very different, except that
they did not trouble about philology and would
have eaten their philologers, while they did without
fishmongers because fish were caught to eat,
not to sell, in those days?”</p>

<p>“Well!” said Aurelius, “we could not live
if we had nothing in common with the cave-men.
A man who was a mere fishmonger or a mere
philologer could not live a day without artificial
aid. Scratch a philologer sufficiently hard and
you will find a sort of a cave-man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“I think,” continued Mr Morgan, “that we
ought to prove our self-respect by going soberly
back on our steps to see what by-ways took
us out of Gwithavon to this point.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you at that game,” said
Aurelius. “I have often played it during church
services, or rather after them. A church service
needs no further defence if it can provide a
number of boys with a chance of good wool-gathering.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” said Mr Torrance, who always
agreed with Aurelius when it was possible. A
fancy had struck him, and instead of turning
it into a sonnet he said: “I like to think that
the original wool-gatherers were men whose
taste it was to wander the mountains and be
before-hand with the nesting birds, gathering
stray wool from the rocks and thorns, a taste
that took them into all sorts of wild new places
without over-loading them with wool, or with
profit or applause.”</p>

<p>“Very pretty, Frank,” said Aurelius, who
had himself now gone wool-gathering and gave
us the benefit of it. He told us that he had just
recalled a church and a preacher whose voice
used to enchant his boyhood into a half-dream.
The light was dim as with gold dust. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
warm and sleepy, and to the boy all the other
worshippers seemed to be asleep. The text
was the three verses of the first chapter of
Genesis which describe the work of creation on
the fifth day. He heard the clergyman’s voice
murmuring, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly
the moving creature that hath life, and
fowl that may fly above the earth in the open
firmament of heaven.”</p>

<p>“That was enough,” said Aurelius, “for
me it was all the sermon. It summoned up
before me a coast of red crags and a black sea
that was white where the waves got lost in the
long corridors between the crags. The moon,
newly formed to rule the night, stood full,
large, and white, at the top of the sky, which was
as black as the sea and cloudless. And out of
the water were rising, by twos and threes, but
sometimes in multitudes like a cloud, the birds
who were to fly in the open firmament of heaven.
Out of the black waste emerged sea-birds, one
at a time, their long white wings spread wide
out at first, but then as they paused on the
surface, uplifted like the sides of a lyre; in a
moment they were skimming this way and
that, and, rising up in circles, were presently
screaming around the moon. Several had only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
risen a little way when, falling back into the
sea, they vanished, there, as I supposed, destined
by the divine purpose to be deprived of their
wings and to become fish. Eagles as red as the
encircling crags came up also, but always solitary;
they ascended as upon a whirlwind in one or
two long spirals and, blackening the moon for
a moment, towered out of sight. The little
singing birds were usually cast up in cloudlets,
white and yellow and blue and dappled, and,
after hovering uncertainly at no great height,
made for the crags, where they perched above
the white foam, piping, warbling, and twittering,
after their own kinds, either singly or in concert.
Ever and anon flocks of those who had soared
now floated downward across the moon and
went over my head with necks outstretched,
crying towards the mountains, moors, and
marshes, or sloped still lower and alighted upon
the water, where they screamed whenever the
surface yawned at a new birth of white or many-coloured
wings. Gradually the sea was chequered
from shore to horizon with birds, and the sky
was throbbing continually with others, so that
the moon could either not be seen at all, or only
in slits and wedges. The crags were covered,
as if with moss and leaves, by lesser birds who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
mingled their voices as if it were a dawn of
May....”</p>

<p>In my turn I now went off wool-gathering, so
that I cannot say how the fifth day ended in
the fancy of Aurelius, if you call it fancy. It
being then near the end of winter, that vision
of birds set me thinking of the nests to come.
I went over in my mind the eggs taken and to be
taken by Philip and me at Lydiard Constantine.
All of last year’s were in one long box, still
haunted by the cheapest scent of the village
shop. I had not troubled to arrange them;
there was a confusion of moor-hens’ and coots’
big freckled eggs with the lesser blue or white or
olive eggs, the blotted, blotched, and scrawled
eggs. For a minute they were forgotten during
the recollection of a poem I had begun to copy
out, and had laid away with the eggs. It was
the first poem I had ever read and re-read for
my own pleasure, and I was copying it out in
my best hand-writing, the capitals in red ink.
I had got as far as “Some mute inglorious
Milton here may rest.” I tried to repeat the
verses but could not, and so I returned to the
eggs. I thought of April when we should once
again butt our way through thickets of stiff,
bristling stems, through thorn and briar and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
bramble in the double hedges. We should
find the thrushes’ nests in a certain copse of
oak and blackthorn where the birds used hardly
anything but moss, and you could see them far
off among the dark branches, which seldom had
many leaves, but were furred over with lichens.
We would go to all those little ponds shadowed
by hazels close to the farms, where there was
likely to be a solitary moorhen’s home, and up
into the pollard willow which once had four
starling’s eggs at the bottom of a long narrow
pocket. In all those spring days we had no
conscious aim but finding nests, and if we were
not scrambling in a wood we walked with heads
lifted up to the trees, turned aside to the hedges,
or bent down to the grass or undergrowth. We
were not curious about the eggs; questions of
numbers or variation in size, shape or colour,
troubled us but fitfully. Sun, rain, wind, deep
mud, water over the boots and knees, scratches
to arms, legs, and face, dust in the eyes, fear
of gamekeepers and farmers, excitement, dizziness,
weariness, all were summed up by the
plain or marked eggs in the scent box; they
were all that visibly remained of these things,
and I valued them in the same way and for the
same reason as the athlete valued the parsley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
crown. The winning of this one or that was
recalled with regret, sometimes that I had
taken more than I should have done from the
same nest, sometimes that I had not taken
as many as would have been excusable; I
blushed with annoyance because we had not
revisited certain nests which were unfinished or
empty when we discovered them&mdash;the plough-boys
doubtless had robbed them completely, or
they had merely produced young birds. How
careless the country boys were, putting eggs
into their hats and often forgetting all about
them, often breaking them wantonly. I envied
them their opportunities and despised them for
making so little use of them.</p>

<p>I thought of the flowers we tramped over,
the smell and taste of cowslips and primroses,
and various leaves, and of the young brier
shoots which we chewed and spat out again as
we walked. I do not know what Aurelius
might have been saying, but I began to count
up the Sundays that must pass before there
would be any chance of finding rooks’ eggs, not
at Lydiard, but at the rookery nearest to Abercorran
House. Thus I was reminded of the
rookery in the half-dozen elms of a farm-house
home field, close by the best fishing-place of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
at Lydiard. There the arrow-headed reeds grew
in thick beds, and the water looked extraordinarily
mysterious on our side of them, as if
it might contain fabulous fish. Only last season
I had left my baited line out there while I
slipped through the neighbouring hedge to look
for a reed-bunting’s nest; and when I returned
I had to pull in an empty line which some
monster had gnawed through, escaping with
hooks and bait. I wonder Philip did not notice.
It was just there, between the beds of arrow-head
and that immense water dock on the brink.
I vowed to try again. Everybody had seen the
monster, or at least the swirl made as he struck
out into the deeps at a passing tread. “As long
as my arm, I daresay,” said the carter, cracking
his whip emphatically with a sort of suggestion
that the fish was not to be caught by the like
of us. Well, we shall see.</p>

<p>As usual the idea of fishing was connected
with my aunt Rachel. There was no fishing
worth speaking of unless we stayed with her in
our holidays. The water in the ponds at Lydiard
Constantine provoked magnificent hopes. I
could have enjoyed fishing by those arrow-heads
without a bait, so fishy did it look, especially
on Sundays, when sport was forbidden:&mdash;it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
unbearable to see that look and lack rod and
line. The fascinating look of water is indescribable,
but it enables me to understand how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Simple Simon went a-fishing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For to catch a whale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But all the water he had got</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was in his mother’s pail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have seen that look in tiny ponds, and have
fished in one against popular advice, only
giving it up because I caught newts there and
nothing else.</p>

<p>But to my wool-gathering. In the Library,
with Aurelius talking, I could see that shadowed
water beside the reeds and the float in the
midst. In fact I always had that picture at
my command. We liked the water best when
it was quite smooth; the mystery was greater,
and we used to think that we caught more
fish out of it in this state. I hoped it would
be a still summer, and warm. It was nearly
three quarters of a year since last we were in
that rookery meadow&mdash;eight months since I
had tasted my aunt’s doughy cake. I can see
her making it, first stoning the raisins while the
dough in a pan by the fire was rising; when
she thought neither of us was looking she stoned
them with her teeth, but this did not shock me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
and now I come to think of it they were very
white even teeth, not too large or too small, so
that I wonder no man ever married her for them
alone. I am glad no man did marry her&mdash;at
least, I was glad then. For she would probably
have given up making doughy cakes full of
raisins and spices, if she had married. I suppose
that what with making cakes and wiping the
dough off her fingers, and wondering if we had
got drowned in the river, she had no time for
lovers. She existed for those good acts which
are mostly performed in the kitchen, for supplying
us with lamb and mint sauce, and rhubarb
tart with cream, when we came in from birds-nesting.
How dull it must be for her, thought
I, sitting alone there at Lydiard Constantine, the
fishing over, the birds not laying yet, no nephews
to be cared for, and therefore no doughy cakes,
for she could not be so greedy as to make them
for herself and herself alone. Aunt Rachel
lived alone, when she was without us, in a little
cottage in a row, at the edge of the village. Hers
was an end house. The rest were neat and
merely a little stained by age; hers was hidden
by ivy, which thrust itself through the walls and
up between the flagstones of the floor, flapped
in at the windows, and spread itself so densely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
over the panes that the mice ran up and down it,
and you could see their pale, silky bellies through
the glass&mdash;often they looked in and entered.
The ivy was full of sparrows’ nests, and the
neighbours were indignant that she would not
have them pulled out; even we respected them.</p>

<p>To live there always, I thought, would be bliss,
provided that Philip was with me, always in a
house covered with ivy and conducted by an
aunt who baked and fried for you and tied
up your cuts, and would clean half a hundred
perchlings for you without a murmur, though
by the end of it her face and the adjacent windows
were covered with the flying scales. “Why
don’t you catch two or three really big ones?”
she would question, sighing for weariness, but
still smiling at us, and putting on her crafty-looking
spectacles. “Whew, if we could,” we
said one to another. It seemed possible for the
moment; for she was a wonderful woman, and
the house wonderful too, no anger, no sorrow,
no fret, such a large fire-place, everything
different from London, and better than anything
in London except Abercorran House. The
ticking of her three clocks was delicious, especially
very early in the morning as you lay awake,
or when you got home tired at twilight, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
lamps were lit. Everything had been as it was
in Aunt Rachel’s house for untold time; it was
natural like the trees; also it was never stale;
you never came down in the morning feeling
that you had done the same yesterday and
would do the same to-morrow, as if each day
was a new, badly written line in a copy-book,
with the same senseless words at the head of
every page. Why couldn’t we always live there?
There was no church or chapel for us&mdash;Philip
had never in his life been to either. Sunday at
Lydiard Constantine was not the day of grim
dulness when everyone was set free from work,
only to show that he or she did not know what
to do or not to do; if they had been chained
slaves these people from Candelent Street and
elsewhere could not have been stiffer or more
savagely solemn.</p>

<p>Those adult people were a different race. I
had no thought that Philip or I could become
like that, and I laughed at them without a
pang, not knowing what was to save Philip
from such an end. How different from those
people was my aunt, her face serene and kind,
notwithstanding that she was bustling about
all day and had trodden her heels down and
had let her hair break out into horns and wisps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>I thought of the race of women and girls. I
thought (with a little pity) that they were nicer
than men. I would rather be a man, I mused,
yet I was sure women were better. I would
not give up my right to be a man some day; but
for the present there was no comparison between
the two in my affections; and I should not
have missed a single man except Aurelius.
Nevertheless, women did odd things. They
always wore gloves when they went out, for
example. Now, if I put gloves on my hands,
it was almost as bad as putting a handkerchief
over my eyes or cotton wool in my ears. They
picked flowers with gloved hands. Certainly
they had their weaknesses. But think of the
different ways of giving an apple. A man
caused it to pass into your hands in a way that
made it annoying to give thanks; a woman
gave herself with it, it was as if the apple were
part of her, and you took it away and ate it in
peace, sitting alone, thinking of nothing. A
boy threw an apple at you as if he wanted to
knock your teeth out with it, and, of course,
you threw it back at him with the same intent;
a girl gave it in such a way that you wanted to
give it back, if you were not somehow afraid.
I began thinking of three girls who all lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
near my aunt and would do anything I wanted,
as if it was not I but they that wanted it. Perhaps
it was. Perhaps they wanted nothing
except to give. Well, and that was rather
stupid, too.</p>

<p>Half released from the spell by one of the
voices in the Library, I turned to a dozen things
at once&mdash;as what time it was, whether one of the
pigeons would have laid its second egg by now,
whether Monday’s post would bring a letter
from a friend who was in Kent, going about
the woods with a gamekeeper who gave him
squirrels, stoats, jays, magpies, an owl, and once
a woodcock, to skin. I recalled the sweet smell
of the squirrels; it was abominable to kill them,
but I liked skinning them.... I turned to
thoughts of the increasing row of books on
my shelf. First came The Compleat Angler.
That gave me a brief entry into a thinly populated
world of men rising early, using strange
baits, catching many fish, talking to milkmaids
with beautiful voices and songs fit for them.
The book&mdash;in a cheap and unattractive edition&mdash;shut
up between its gilded covers a different,
embalmed, enchanted life without any care.
Philip and I knew a great deal of it by heart,
and took a strong fancy to certain passages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and phrases, so that we used to repeat out of
all reason “as wholesome as a pearch of Rhine,”
which gave a perfect image of actual perch
swimming in clear water down the green streets
of their ponds on sunny days.... Then there
were Sir Walter Scott’s poems, containing the
magic <span class="lock">words&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And, Saxon, I am Rhoderick Dhu.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, Robinson Crusoe, Grimm’s Fairy Tales,
the Iliad, a mass of almost babyish books,
tattered and now never touched, and lastly
The Adventures of King Arthur and the
Round Table. I heard the Lady of the Lake
say to Merlin (who had a face like Aurelius)
“Inexorable man, thy powers are resistless”:
moonlit waters overhung by mountains, and
crags crowned by towers, boats with mysterious
dark freight; knights taller than Roland,
trampling and glittering; sorceries, battles,
dragons, kings, and maidens, stormed or flitted
through my mind, some only as words and
phrases, some as pictures. It was a shadow
entertainment, with an indefinable quality of
remoteness tinged by the pale Arthurian moonlight
and its reflection in that cold lake, which
finally suggested the solid comfort of tea at my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
aunt’s house, and thick slices, “cut ugly,” of
the doughy cake.</p>

<p>At this point Jessie came in to say that tea
was ready. “So am I,” said I, and we raced
downstairs. Jessie won.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">ABERCORRAN AND MORGAN’S FOLLY</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Once or twice I joined Philip on a holiday in
Wales, but not at Abercorran. It was years
later that I found myself by chance at Abercorran
and saw enough of it to spoil somewhat
the beautiful fantastic geography learned from
a thousand references by Philip, Jessie, and old
Ann. The real place&mdash;as it may be seen
by anyone who can pay the railway fare&mdash;is
excellent, but I think I should never have
gone there had I foreseen its effect on that old
geography. Having seen the place with these
eyes I cannot recover perfectly the original
picture of the castle standing at the meet of
two small rivers and looking over their wide
estuary, between the precipices of enormous
hills, to the sea; the tiny deserted quay, the
broken cross on the open space glistening with
ever-renewed cockle shells, below the castle;
the long, stately street leading from the church
down to the castle, named Queen Street because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
an English queen once rode down it; the castle
owls and the inexhaustible variety and the
everlasting motion of the birds of the estuary.
To see it as the Morgans once made me see it
you must be able to cover the broad waters with
glistening white breasts, at the same moment
that its twin precipices abide in gloom that
has been from the beginning; you must hear
an undertone of the age of Arthur, or at least of
the great Llewelyn, in the hoots of the castle
owls, and give a quality of kingliness to a street
which has a wide pavement on one side, it is
true, but consists for the most part of cottages,
with a castle low down at one end, and at the
other a church high up.</p>

<p>The Morgans’ old house, far above the townlet
of Abercorran, had windows commanding
mountains behind as well as sea in front. Their
tales had given me, at the beginning, an idea
of mountains, as distinct from those objects
resembling saw teeth by which they are sometimes
represented. They formed the foundation
of my idea of mountains. Then upon that
I raised slowly a magnificent edifice by means
of books of travel and of romance. These
later elements were also added unto the Welsh
mountains where Jack found the kite’s nest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
where Roland saw an eagle, where Philip had
learnt the ways of raven, buzzard, and curlew,
of badger, fox, and otter. My notions of their
size had been given to me by Ann, in a story of
two men who were lost on them in the mist.
For three days the men were neither seen nor
heard in their wanderings; on the fourth they
were discovered by chance, one dead, the other
mad. These high solitudes, I thought, must
keep men wild in their minds, and still more I
thought so after hearing of the runaway boy
from Ann’s own parish. He lived entirely out
of doors&mdash;without stealing, said Ann&mdash;for a
year and a half. Every now and then someone
caught sight of him, but that was all the news.
He told nothing when he was arrested on the
charge of setting fire to a rick. Ann said that if
he did this it was an accident, but they wanted
to get rid of the scandal of the “wild boy,” so
they packed him off to a training ship until
he was sixteen. “He would have thought it
a piece of luck,” said Ann, “to escape from the
ship, however it was, for he thought it worse
than any weather on the mountains; and before
he was sixteen he did escape&mdash;he fell overboard
by some mercy, and was never seen again
on sea or land, my children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>But above all other tales of the mountains
was the one that had David Morgan for hero.
David Morgan was the eldest brother of the
Morgans of Abercorran House. He had been
to London before ever the family thought of
quitting their Welsh home; in a year’s time he
had returned with an inveterate melancholy.
After remaining silent, except to his mother,
for some months, he left home to build himself
a house up in the mountains. When I was
at Abercorran, Morgan’s Folly&mdash;so everybody
called it&mdash;was in ruins, but still made a black
letter against the sky when the north was clear.
People imagined that he had hidden gold somewhere
among the rocks. He was said to have
worshipped a god who never entered chapel or
church. He was said to speak with raven and
fox. He was said to pray for the end of man
or of the world. Atheist, blasphemer, outlaw,
madman, brute, were some of the names he
received in rumour. But the last that was
positively known of him was that, one summer,
he used to come down night after night, courting
the girl Angharad who became his wife.</p>

<p>One of his obsessions in solitude, so said his
mother when I travelled down with her to see the
last of him, was a belief in a race who had kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
themselves apart from the rest of men, though
found among many nations, perhaps all. The
belief may have come from the Bible, and this
was the race that grew up alongside the family
of Cain, the guiltless “daughters of men” from
whom the children of the fratricides obtained
their wives. These, untainted with the blood
of Cain, knew not sin or shame&mdash;so his belief
seems to have been&mdash;but neither had they souls.
They were a careless and a godless race, knowing
not good or evil. They had never been cast
out of Eden. “In fact,” said Mrs Morgan,
“they must be something like Aurelius.” Some
of the branches of this race had already been
exterminated by men; for example, the Nymphs
and Fauns. David Morgan was not afraid of
uttering his belief. Others of them, he said,
had adopted for safety many of men’s ways.
They had become moorland or mountain men
living at peace with their neighbours, but not
recognised as equals. They were to be found
even in the towns. There the uncommon
beauty of the women sometimes led to unions
of violent happiness and of calamity, and to the
birth of a poet or musician who could abide
neither with the strange race nor with the
children of Adam. They were feared but more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
often despised, because they retained what
men had lost by civilisation, because they lived
as if time was not, yet could not be persuaded
to believe in a future life.</p>

<p>Up in his tower Morgan came to believe his
own father one of this people, and resolved to
take a woman from amongst them for a wife.
Angharad, the shy, the bold, the fierce dark
Angharad whose black eyes radiated light and
blackness together, was one of them. She
became his wife and went up with him to the
tower. After that these things only were certainly
known; that she was unhappy; that
when she came down to the village for food she
was silent, and would never betray him or fail
to return; and that he himself never came
down, that he also was silent and with his unshorn
hair looked like a wild man. He was seen
at all hours, usually far off, on the high paths
of the mountains. His hair was as black as in
boyhood. He was never known to have ailed,
until one day the wild wife knocked at a farm-house
door near Abercorran, asking for help to
bring him where he might be looked after, since
he would have no one in the tower but her.
The next day Mrs Morgan travelled down to see
her son. When she asked me to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
her I did so with some curiosity; for I had
already become something of a stranger at
Abercorran House, and had often wondered
what had become of David Morgan up on his
tower. His mother talked readily of his younger
days and his stay in London. Though he had
great gifts, some said genius, which he might
have been expected to employ in the study, he
had applied himself to direct social work. For
a year he laboured “almost as hard,” he said,
“as the women who make our shirts.” But
gradually he formed the opinion that he did
not understand town life, that he never could
understand the men and women whom he saw
living a town life pure and simple. Before he
came amongst them he had been thinking
grandly about men without realising that these
were of a different species. His own interference
seemed to him impudent. They disgusted
him, he wanted to make them more or less in his
own image to save his feelings, which, said he,
was absurd. He was trying to alter the conditions
of other men’s lives because he could not
have himself endured them, because it would
have been unpleasant to him to be like them in
their hideous pleasure, hideous suffering, hideous
indifference. In this attitude, which altogether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
neglected the consolations and even beauty and
glory possible or incident to such a life, he saw
a modern Pharisaism whose followers did not
merely desire to be unlike others, but to make
others like themselves. It was, he thought, due
to lack of the imagination and sympathy to see
their lives from a higher or a more intimate
point of view, in connection with implicit ideals,
not as a spectacle for which he had an expensive
seat. Did they fall farther short of their ideals
than he from his? He had not the power to
see, but he thought not; and he came to believe
that, lacking as their life might be in familiar
forms of beauty and power, it possessed, nevertheless,
a profound unconsciousness and dark
strength which might some day bring forth
beauty&mdash;might even now be beautiful to simple
and true eyes&mdash;and had already given them a
fitness to their place which he had for no place
on earth. When it was food and warmth which
were lacking he never hesitated to use his
money, but beyond satisfying these needs he
could not feel sure that he was not fancifully
interfering with a force which he did not understand
and could not overestimate. Therefore,
leaving all save a little of his money to be spent
in directly supplying the needs of hungry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
cold men, he escaped from the sublime, unintelligible
scene. He went up into the tower
that he had built on a rock in his own mountains,
to think about life before he began to live. Up
there, said his mother, he hoped to learn why
sometimes in a London street, beneath the new
and the multitudinous, could be felt a simple
and a pure beauty, beneath the turmoil a
placidity, beneath the noise a silence which he
longed to reach and drink deeply and perpetuate,
but in vain. It was his desire to learn to see in
human life, as we see in the life of bees, the unity,
which perhaps some higher order of beings
can see through the complexity which confuses
us. He had set out to seek at first by means
of science, but he thought that science was an
end, not a means. For a hundred years, he
said, men had been reading science and investigating,
as they had been reading history, with
the result that they knew some science and
some history. “So he went up into his tower,
and there he has been these twelve years,” said
Mrs Morgan, “with Angharad and no comforts.
You would think by his letters that his thoughts
had become giddy up there. Only five letters
have I had from him in these twelve years.
This is all,” she added, showing a small packet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
in her handbag. “For the last six years nobody
has heard from him except Ann. He wished
he had asked Ann to go with him to the tower.
She would have gone, too. She would have
preserved him from being poetical. It is true
he was only twenty-five years old at the time,
but he was too poetical. He said things which
he was bound to repent in a year, perhaps in
a day. He writes quite seriously, as actors
half seriously talk, in tones quite inhumanly
sublime.” She read me scraps from these
old letters, evidently admiring as well as
disapproving:</p>

<p>“I am alone. From my tower I look out
at the huge desolate heaves of the grey beacons.
Their magnitude and pure form give me a great
calm. Here is nothing human, gentle, disturbing,
as there is in the vales. There is nothing
but the hills and the silence, which is God.
The greater heights, set free from night and
the mist, look as if straight from the hands of
God, as if here He also delighted in pure form
and magnitude that are worthy of His love.
The huge shadows moving slowly over the grey
spaces of winter, the olive spaces of summer,
are as God’s hand....</p>

<p>“While I watch, the dream comes, more and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
more often, of a Paradise to be established upon
the mountains when at last the wind shall blow
sweet over a world that knows not the taint of
life any more than of death. Then my thought
sweeps rejoicing through the high Gate of the
Winds that cleaves the hills&mdash;you could see it
from my bedroom at Abercorran&mdash;far off, where
a shadow miles long sleeps across the peaks,
but leaves the lower wild as yellow in the sunlight
as corn....</p>

<p>“Following my thought I have walked upwards
to that Gate of the Winds, to range the
high spaces, sometimes to sleep there. Or I
have lain among the gorse&mdash;I could lie on my
back a thousand years, hearing the cuckoo in
the bushes and looking up at the blue sky
above the mountains. In the rain and wind I
have sat against one of the rocks in the autumn
bracken until the sheep have surrounded me,
shaggy and but half visible through the mist,
peering at me fearlessly, as if they had not seen
a man since that one was put to rest under the
cairn above; I sat on and on in the mystery,
part of it but not divining, so that I went
disappointed away. The crags stared at me
on the hill-top where the dark spirits of the
earth had crept out of their abysses into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
day, and, still clad in darkness, looked grimly
at the sky, the light, and at me....</p>

<p>“More and more now I stay in the tower,
since even in the mountains as to a greater
extent in the cities of men, I am dismayed by
numbers, by variety, by the grotesque, by the
thousand gods demanding idolatry instead of
the One I desire, Whose hand’s shadow I have
seen far off....</p>

<p>“Looking on a May midnight at Algol rising
from behind a mountain, the awe and the glory
of that first step into the broad heaven exalted
me; a sound arose as of the whole of Time
making music behind me, a music as of something
passing away to leave me alone in the
silence, so that I also were about to step off into
the air....”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs Morgan, “it would do him
good to do something&mdash;to keep a few pigeons,
now. I am afraid he will take to counting
the stones in his tower.” She continued her
quotations:</p>

<p>“The moon was rising. The sombre ranges
eastward seemed to be the edge of the earth,
and as the orb ascended, the world was emptied
and grieved, having given birth to this mighty
child. I was left alone. The great white clouds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
sat round about on the horizon, judging me.
For days I lay desolate and awake, and dreamed
and never stirred.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Mrs Morgan, “that London
could not cure him. He says:</p>

<p>“‘I have visited London. I saw the city
pillared, above the shadowy abyss of the river,
on columns of light; and it was less than one
of my dreams. It was Winter and I was resolved
to work again in Poplar. I was crossing one
of the bridges, full of purpose and thought,
going against the tide of the crowd. The
morning had a low yellow roof of fog. About
the heads of the crowd swayed a few gulls,
inter-lacing so that they could not be counted.
They swayed like falling snow and screamed.
They brought light on their long wings, as the
ship below, setting out slowly with misty masts,
brought light to the green and leaden river upon
the foam at her bows. And ever about the
determined, careless faces of the men swayed
the pale wings, like wraiths of evil and good,
calling and calling to ears that know not what
they hear. And they tempted my brain with
the temptation of their beauty: I went to and
fro to hear and to see them until they slept and
the crowd had flowed away. I rejoiced that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
day, for I thought that this beauty had made
ready my brain, and that on the mountains
at last I should behold the fulness and the
simplicity of beauty. So I went away without
seeing Poplar. But there, again, among the
mountains was weariness, because I also was
there.’”</p>

<p>“Why is he always weary?” asked Mrs
Morgan plaintively, before reading on:</p>

<p>“But not always weariness. For have I not
the company of planet and star in the heavens,
the same as bent over prophet, poet, and philosopher
of old? By day a scene unfolds as
when the first man spread forth his eyes and
saw more than his soul knew. These things lift
up my heart sometimes for days together, so
that the voices of fear and doubt are not so
much in that infinite silence as rivulets in an
unbounded plain. The sheer mountains, on
some days, seem to be the creation of my
own lean terrible thoughts, and I am glad:
the soft, wooded hills below and behind
seem the creation of the pampered luxurious
thought which I have left in the world of
many men....</p>

<p>“Would that I could speak in the style of
the mountains. But language, except to genius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and simple men, is but a paraphrase, dissipating
and dissolving the forms of passion and
thought....</p>

<p>“Again Time lured me back out of Eternity,
and I believed that I longed to die as I lay and
watched the sky at sunset inlaid with swart
forest, and watched it with a dull eye and a cold
heart....”</p>

<p>“And they think he is an atheist. They
think he has buried gold on the mountain,”
exclaimed Mrs Morgan, indignantly.</p>

<p>Little she guessed of the nights before her in
the lone farmhouse with her bewildered son
and the wild Angharad. While he raved through
his last hours and Angharad spent herself in
wailing, and Mrs Morgan tried to steady his
thoughts, I could only walk about the hills.
I climbed to the tower, but learnt nothing
because Morgan or his wife had set fire
to it on leaving, and the shell of stones only
remained.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning, after a night of storm,
all was over. That morning once more I could
hear the brook’s murmur which had been obliterated
by the storm and by thought. The air was
clear and gentle in the coomb behind the farm,
and all but still after the night of death and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
great wind. High up in the drifting rose of
dawn the tall trees were swaying their tips as if
stirred by memories of the tempest. They made
no sound in the coomb with the trembling
of their slender length; some were never to
sound again, for they lay motionless and prone
in the underwood, or hung slanting among
neighbour branches, where they fell in the
night&mdash;the rabbits could nibble at crests which
once wavered about the stars. The path was
strewn with broken branches and innumerable
twigs.</p>

<p>The silence was so great that I could hear,
by enchantment of the ears, the departed storm.
Yet the tragic repose was unbroken. One robin
singing called up the roars and tumults that had
to cease utterly before his voice could gain this
power of peculiar sweetness and awe and make
itself heard.</p>

<p>The mountains and sky, beautiful as they
were, were more beautiful because a cloak of
terror had been lifted from them and left them
free to the dark and silver, and now rosy, dawn.
The masses of the mountains were still heavy and
sombre, but their ridges and the protruding
tower bit sharply into the sky; the uttermost
peaks appeared again, dark with shadows of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
clouds of a most lustrous whiteness that hung
like a white forest, very far off, in the country
of the sun. Seen out of the clear gloom of the
wood this country was as a place to which
a man might wholly and vainly desire to go,
knowing that he would be at rest there and
there only.</p>

<p>As I listened, walking the ledge between
precipice and precipice in the coomb, the silence
murmured of the departed tempest like a sea-shell.
I could hear the dark hills convulsed
with a hollow roaring as of an endless explosion.
All night the trees were caught up and shaken
in the furious air like grasses; the sounds on
earth were mingled with those of the struggle
in the high spaces of air. Outside the window
branches were brandished wildly, and their
anger was the more terrible because the voice
of it could not be distinguished amidst the
universal voice. The sky itself seemed to aid
the roar, as the stars raced over it among floes
of white cloud, and dark menacing fragments
flitted on messages of darkness across the white.
I looked out from the death room, having turned
away from the helpless, tranquil bed and the
still wife, and saw the hillside trees surging
under a wild moon, but they were strange and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
no longer to be recognised, while the earth was
heaving and be-nightmared by the storm. It
was the awe of that hour which still hung
over the coomb, making its clearness so solemn,
its silence so pregnant, its gentleness so sublime.
How fresh it was after the sick room, how calm
after the vain conflict with death.</p>

<p>The blue smoke rose straight up from the
house of death, over there in the white fields,
where the wife sat and looked at the dead.
Everyone else was talking of the strange life
just ended, but the woman who had shared it
would tell nothing; she wished only to persuade
us that in spite of his extraordinary life he was
a good man and very good to her. She had
become as silent as Morgan himself, though
eleven years before, when she began to live with
him on the mountain, she was a happy, gay
woman, the best dancer and singer in the village,
and had the most lovers. Upon the mountain
her wholly black Silurian eyes had turned inwards
and taught her lips their mystery and Morgan’s.
They buried him, according to his wish, at the
foot of the tower. Outraged by this, some of
the neighbours removed his body to the churchyard
under the cover of night. Others equally
enraged at putting such a one in consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
ground, exhumed him again. But in the end
it was in the churchyard that his bones came
to rest, with the inscription, chosen by Ann:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Angharad married a pious eccentric much older
than herself, and in a year inherited his money.
She lives on in one of those gray houses which
make Queen Street so stately at Abercorran.
She keeps no company but that of the dead.
The children call her Angharad of the Folly, or
simply Angharad Folly.</p>

<p>“She ought to have gone back to the tower,”
said Mr Torrance in some anger.</p>

<p>“She would have done, Mr Torrance,” said
Ann, “if she had been a poet; but you would
not have done it if you had been through those
eleven years and those four nights. No, I really
don’t think you would.... I knew a poet who
jumped into a girl’s grave, but he was not buried
with her. Now you are angry with him, poor
fellow, because he did not insist on being buried.
Well, but it is lucky he was not, because if he
had been we should not have known he was a
poet.”</p>

<p>“Well said, Ann,” muttered Aurelius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Ann forgets that she was young once,”
protested Mr Torrance.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I don’t think I do, but I
think this, that you forget you will some day
be old. Now, as this is Shrove Tuesday and
you will be wanting pancakes I must go make
them.”</p>

<p>“Good old Ann,” whispered Mr Torrance.</p>

<span class="smaller">MR TORRANCE THE CHEERFUL MAN</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Mr Torrance openly objected to Ann’s epitaph
for David Morgan, preferring his own choice
of one from Shelley’s “Mont Blanc”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If to the human mind’s imaginings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Silence and solitude were vacancy?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“But” said Mr Morgan, “Shelley was born
only a hundred years ago, and died at thirty,
I think that in the matter of mountains an
older man is better.”</p>

<p>“But, father,” said Roland, “how do you
know that Jeremiah was not drowned at thirty
with a copy of ‘Ecclesiastes’ clasped to his
bosom?”</p>

<p>“You read and see, my son,” answered Mr
Morgan. “Shelley could not pass himself off
as an old man, though you know he did once
claim to be eighty-nine, and Jeremiah would
not have pretended to be thirty. That is only
my opinion. I prefer the prophet, like Ann.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Mr Torrance muttered that anyone who
preferred Jeremiah to Shelley had no right to
an opinion. It was just like Mr Torrance. He
was always saying foolish things and fairly often
doing them, and yet we felt, and Mr Morgan
once declared, that he had in him the imperishable
fire of a divine, mysterious wisdom. After
walking the full length of the Abbey Road,
where he lived, to discover him smiling in his
dark study, was sufficient proof that he had a
wisdom past understanding.</p>

<p>Abbey Road was over two miles long. At
its south end was a double signboard, pointing
north “To London,” south “To Forden, Field,
and Cowmore”; at its north end it ran into
pure London. Every year the horse-chestnut
branches had to be shortened in May because
their new leaf smothered the signboard. As if
anyone who had reached that point could wish
to be directed to London! Almost as few could
wish to know the way in order to avoid it. But
the horse-chestnut had to suffer. It was fortunate
in not being cut down altogether and carried
away. The cemetery saved it. The acute angle
between the Abbey Road and another was filled
by a large new cemetery, and the tree was the
first of a long line within its railings. Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
had the signboard been on the other side of the
road it would have been as badly off among the
tall thorns and stunted elms of the hedges.
Behind this hedge was a waste, wet field, grazed
over by a sad horse or two all through the year;
for on account partly of the cemetery, partly
of the factory which manufactured nobody quite
knew what except stench, this field could not
be let or sold. Along its far side ran a river
which had no sooner begun to rejoice in its
freedom to make rush and reed at pleasure on
the border of the field than it found itself at
the walls of the factory. Northward, past the
cemetery and the factory, began the houses of
Abbey Road, first a new house, occupied but
with a deserted though not wild garden, and next
to it a twin house, left empty. Then followed a
sluttery of a few pairs or blocks of small houses,
also new, on both sides of the road&mdash;new and yet
old, with the faces of children who are smeared,
soiled, and doomed, at two. They bordered
on the old inn, “The Woodman’s Arms,”
formerly the first house, having a large kitchen
garden, and masses of dahlias and sunflowers
behind. It lay back a good space from the road,
and this space was gravel up to the porch, and
in the middle of it stood a stone drinking trough.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Often a Gypsy’s cart and a couple of long dogs
panting in the sun were to be seen outside,
helping the inn to a country look, a little dingy
and decidedly private and homely, so that what
with the distance between the road and the front
door, and the Gypsy’s cart, the passer-by was
apt to go on until he came to an ordinary building
erected for the sale of beer and spirits, and for
nothing else. Such a one lay not much further
on, beyond a row of cottages contemporary with
“The Woodman’s Arms.” These had long
narrow gardens behind wooden posts and rails&mdash;gardens
where everything tall, old-fashioned,
and thick grew at their own sweet will, almost
hiding the cottages of wood covered in creeper.
You could just see that some were empty, their
windows smashed or roughly boarded up, and
that others were waiting for some old woman to
die before they also had their windows smashed
or boarded up. The dahlias, the rose-of-Sharon,
the sweet rocket, the snow-on-the-mountains,
the nasturtiums, the sunflowers, flourished too
thick for weeds to make headway, and so probably
with small help from the inhabitants, the
gardens earned many a wave of the whip from
passing drivers. The row of cottages meant
“the first bit of country,” with a sweep at one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
end, a rat-catcher at the other, announced in
modest lettering. Between the last of them
and the new public-house a puddled lane ran
up along old and thick, but much broken,
hedges to the horse-slaughterer’s. “The Victoria
Hotel” was built in the Jubilee year of that
sovereign, and was a broad-faced edifice of brick
with too conspicuous stone work round the
windows and doorways and at the corners. The
doors were many and mostly of glass. The
landlord of “The Victoria” had no time to
stand on his doorstep&mdash;whichever was his&mdash;like
the landlord of “The Woodman”; moreover, all
his doorsteps were right on the road, and he
could have seen only the long row of cottages,
by the same builder, which looked as if cut off
from a longer, perhaps an endless row, with a
pair of shears; while from the old inn could be
seen grass sloping to the willows of the river,
and a clump of elms hiding the factory chimneys.
All the glass and brass of the “Victoria” shone
spotless as if each customer out of the regiments
in the crowded straight streets gave it a rub on
entering and leaving.</p>

<p>Beyond the “Victoria” the road straightened
itself after a twist, and was now lined by a
hundred houses of one pattern but broken by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
several branch streets. These were older houses
of gray stucco, possessing porches, short flights
of steps up to the doors, basements, and the
smallest of front gardens packed with neglected
laurel, privet, marigold, and chickweed. At
the end of the hundred&mdash;at No. 367&mdash;a man
walking “To London” would begin to feel
tired, and would turn off the pavement into the
road, or else cross to the other side where the
scattered new shops and half-built houses had
as yet no footway except uneven bare earth.
On this side the turnings were full of new houses
and pavements, and admitted the eye to views
of the welter of slate roofs crowding about the
artificial banks of the river which ran as in a pit.
Of the branch streets interrupting the stucco
hundred, one showed a wide, desolate, untouched
field of more and more thistles in the middle,
more and more nettles at the edge, and, facing
it, a paltry miracle of brand-new villas newly
risen out of a similar field; the second was the
straight line of a new street, with kerb-stones
neat and new, but not a house yet among the
nettles; another, an old lane, was still bordered
by tender-leafed lime trees, preserved to deck
the gardens of houses to come. The lane now
and then had a Gypsy’s fire in it for a few hours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and somebody had told the story that Aurelius
was born under one of the trees; to which
Aurelius answered, “The trees and I were born
about the same time, but a hundred miles apart.”</p>

<p>The stucco line gave way to a short row of
brick houses, low and as plain as possible, lying
well back from the road behind their split-oak
fences, thorn hedges, laburnums and other fancy
trees. Ivy climbed over all; each was neat and
cheerful, but the group had an exclusive expression.
Yet they had to look upon half-built
shops and houses, varied by a stretch of tarred
and barbed fence protecting the playing ground
of some football club, whose notice board stood
side by side with an advertisement of the land
for building on leasehold; over the fence leaned
an old cart-horse with his hair between his
eyes.</p>

<p>There followed repetitions and variations of
these things&mdash;inhabited houses, empty houses,
houses being erected, fields threatened by houses&mdash;and
finally a long, gloomy unbroken cliff of
stained stucco. The tall houses, each with a
basement and a long flight of steps up to a
pillared porch, curved away to the number 593,
and the celebrated “Horse-shoe Hotel” next
door, which looked with dignity and still more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
ostentation, above its potted bay-trees, on the
junction of Abbey Road and two busy thoroughfares.
Opposite the tall stucco cliff a continuous
but uneven line of newish mean shops of every
kind and not more than half the height of the
private houses, curved to a public-house as
large as the “Horse-shoe” which it faced.</p>

<p>As each rook knows its nest among the scores
on the straight uniform beeches, so doubtless
each inhabitant could after a time distinguish
his own house in this monotonous series, even
without looking at the number, provided that
there was light and that he was not drunk.
Each house had three storeys, the first of them
bay-windowed, above the basement. Probably
each was divided between two, or, like No. 497,
between three, families. Who had the upper
storeys I never knew, except that there was an
old woman who groaned on the stairs, a crying
baby and its mother, and some men. I heard
them speak, or cry, or tread the stairs lightly
or heavily, but never happened to see any of
them, unless that woman was one who was
going to enter the gate at the same time as I
one evening, but at the sight of me went past
with a jug of something half hid under her black
jacket. The basement, the floor above, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the garden, were rented to one family, viz., Mr
Torrance, his wife and four children.</p>

<p>The garden was a square containing one permanent
living thing, and one only, an apple
tree which bore large fluted apples of palest
yellow on the one bough remaining green among
the grey barkless ones. All round the tree the
muddy gravel had been trodden, by children
playing, so hard that not a weed or blade of grass
ever pierced it. Up to it and down to it led two
narrow and steep flights of steps, the lower for the
children and the mother ascending from the
kitchen or living room, the upper for Mr Torrance
who used to sit in the back room writing books,
except in the mornings when he taught drawing
at several schools. He wrote at an aged and
time-worn black bureau, from which he could
sometimes see the sunlight embracing the apple
tree. But into that room the sunlight could
not enter without a miracle, or by what so seldom
happened as to seem one&mdash;the standing open of
an opposite window just so that it threw a reflection
of the late sun for about three minutes.
Even supposing that the sunlight came that
way, little could have penetrated that study;
for the French windows were ponderously draped
by tapestry of dark green with a black pattern,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and on one side the bureau, on the other a bookcase,
stood partly before the panes. No natural
light could reach the ceiling or the corners.
Instead of light, books covered the walls,
books in a number of black-stained bookcases
of various widths, all equal in height with the
room, except one that was cut short by a grate
in which I never saw a fire. The other few
interspaces held small old pictures or prints in
dark frames, and a dismal canvas darkened,
probably, by some friendly hand. Most of the
books were old, many were very old. The huge,
blackened slabs of theology and drama emitted
nothing but gloom. The red bindings which
make some libraries tolerable had been exorcised
from his shelves by the spirits of black
and of darkest brown.</p>

<p>The sullen host of books left little room for
furniture. Nevertheless, there was a massive
table of ancient oak, always laden with books,
and apparently supported by still other books.
Six chairs of similar character had long succeeded
in retaining places in front of the books, justifying
themselves by bearing each a pile or a
chaos of books. Dark as wintry heather were
the visible portions of the carpet. The door
was hung with the same black and green tapestry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
as the windows; if opened, it disclosed the
mere blackness of a passage crowded with more
books and ancestral furniture.</p>

<p>Yet Mr Torrance smiled whenever a visitor, or
his wife, or one or all of his children, but, above
all, when Aurelius entered the room. No doubt
he did not always smile when he was alone
writing; for he wrote what he was both reluctant
and incompetent to write, at the request of a
firm of publishers whose ambition was to have
a bad, but nice-looking, book on everything
and everybody, written by some young university
man with private means, by some vegetarian
spinster, or a doomed hack like Mr Torrance.
Had he owned copies of all these works they
would have made a long row of greens and reds
decorated by patterns and lettering in gold.
He did not speak of his work, or of himself,
but listened, smiled, or&mdash;with the children&mdash;laughed,
and allowed himself at worst the
remark that things were not so bad as they
seemed. He was full of laughter, but all clever
people thought him devoid of humour. In
his turn, he admired all clever people, but was
uninfluenced by them, except that he read
the books which they praised and at once
forgot them&mdash;he had read Sir Thomas Browne’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
“Quincunx,” but could not say what a Quincunx
was. Aurelius used to tease him sometimes, I
think, in order to prove that the smile was
invincible. Mr Torrance was one of the slowest
and ungainliest of men, but he was never out of
love or even out of patience with Aurelius, the
most lightsome of men, or of the superfluous race.
He had fine wavy hair like silk fresh from the
cocoon, and blue eyes of perfect innocence and
fearlessness placed well apart in a square, bony,
and big-nosed face that was always colourless.
As he wrote, one or all of the children were likely
to cry until they were brought into his study,
where he had frequently to leave them to avoid
being submerged in the chaos set moving by
their play. He smiled at it, or if he could not
smile, he laughed. If the children were silent
for more than a little time he would go out into
the passage and call downstairs to make sure
that all was well, whereupon at least one must
cry, and his wife must shriek to him in that
high, sour voice which was always at the edge
of tears. Often she came before he called, to
stand at his door, talking, complaining, despairing,
weeping; and though very sorry, Mr
Torrance smiled, and as soon as she had slammed
the door he went on with his exquisite small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
handwriting, or, at most, he went out and
counted the apples again. One or more of
the children was always ill, nor was any ever
well. They were untidy, graceless, and querulous,
in looks resembling their mother, whose
face seemed to have grown and shaped itself
to music&mdash;a music that would set the teeth of
a corpse on edge. She was never at the end of
her work, but often of her strength. She was
cruel to all in her impatience, and in her swift,
giddy remorse cruel to herself also. She seemed
to love and enjoy nothing, yet she would not
leave the house on any account, and seldom
her work. Whatever she did she could not
ruffle her husband or wring from him anything
but a smile and a slow, kind sentence. Not that
he was content, or dull, or made of lead or wood.
He would have liked to dress his wife and
children as prettily as they could choose, to
ride easily everywhere, anywhere, all over the
world if it pleased them, seeing, hearing, tasting
nothing but what they thought best on earth.
But save in verse he never did so. It was one
of his pains that seldom more than once or
twice a year came the mood for doing what
seemed to him the highest he could, namely,
write verses. Also he had bad health; his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
pipe, of the smallest size, half filled with the
most harmless and tasteless tobacco, lay cold
on the bureau, just tasted and then allowed to
go out. Ale he loved, partly for its own sake,
partly to please Aurelius, but it did not love
him. It was one of the jokes concerning him,
that he could not stand the cold of his morning
bath unless he repeated the words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Up with me, up with me, into the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For thy song, lark, is strong.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He said them rapidly, and in an agony of
solemnity, as he squeezed the sponge, and
though this fact had become very widely known
indeed, he did not give up the habit. Had he
given up every kind of food condemned by himself
or his doctors, he would have lived solely on
love in that dark, that cold, that dead room.
He was fond of company, but he knew nobody
in all those thronged streets, unless it was an
old woman or two, and their decrepit, needy
husbands. He was a farmer’s son, and knew
little more of London than Ann, since he had
moved into Abbey Road shortly after his first
child was born, and had not been able to extricate
himself from the books and furniture.</p>

<p>I see him, as soon as I have sat down by the
window, swing round in his chair and look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
grim as he lights his tobacco with difficulty&mdash;then
smile and let the smoke pour out of his
mouth before beginning to talk, which means
that in a few minutes he has laid down the
pipe unconsciously, and that it will remain
untouched. The children come in; he opens
the French windows, and goes down the steps
to the apple tree, carrying half the children,
followed by the other half. Up he climbs,
awkwardly in his black clothes, and getting
that grim look under the strain, but smiling at
last. He picks all of the seven apples and
descends with them. The children are perfectly
silent. “This one,” he begins, “is for Annie
because she is so small. And this for Jack
because he is a good boy. And this for Claude
because he is bad and we are all sorry for him.
And this for Dorothy because she is so big.”
He gives me one, and Dorothy another to take
down to her mother, and the last he stows away.</p>

<p>Mr Torrance was often fanciful, and as most
people said, affected, in speech. He was full
of what appeared to be slight fancies that
made others blush uncomfortably. He had rash
admirations for more conspicuously fanciful
persons, who wore extraordinary clothes or ate
or drank in some extraordinary manner. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
never said an unkind thing. By what aid, in
addition to the various brown breads to which
he condemned himself, did he live, and move,
and have his being with such gladness?</p>

<p>His books are not the man. They are known
only to students at the British Museum who
get them out once and no more, for they
discover hasty compilations, ill-arranged, inaccurate,
and incomplete, and swollen to a
ridiculous size for the sake of gain. They
contain not one mention of the house under
the hill where he was born.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smaller">THE HOUSE UNDER THE HILL</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Though he did not write of it, Mr Torrance
would gladly talk of the house under the hill
where he was born, of the surrounding country
and its people. “I can only hope,” he would
say, “I can only hope that when I am old, ‘in
this our pinching cave,’ I shall remember
chiefly the valley of the river Uther where I
was born, and the small old house half encircled
and half-shadowed by an enormous crescent of
beech-covered hills. That is my world in spite
of everything. Those fifteen or twenty square
miles make the one real thing that I know and
cannot forget, in spite of a hundred English
scenes wantonly visited and forgotten, in spite
of London unforgotten and unintelligible.</p>

<p>“A brook ran out of the hills where they were
nearest to us, about half a mile away. Dark
trees darkened the two springs of crystal, and
the lightest wind made a sad sound in the
leaves above them. Before it had travelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
a quarter of a mile the brook had gathered
about itself a brotherhood of huge trees that
always seemed to belong to it, and gave it
pomp and mystery together, if the combination
is possible. These were sunny trees, a line of
towering tall black poplars that led out from
the hills to the open agricultural land, a group
of the mightiest wych-elms I have ever seen,
and one ash-tree standing alone at the water’s
edge, the only one of its kind in the neighbourhood.
Three miles from its source the brook
ran into the main stream of the river Uther,
and beyond that I knew nothing except by
rumour and guessing. A line drawn between
the two ends of the crescent of hills would pass
through the junction of brook and river and
enclose the country which was mine entirely.
The long line of hills far off on the other side
of the valley&mdash;bare, rounded, and cloud-like
hills, whose curving ridges seemed to have
growth and change like clouds&mdash;was the
boundary of the real world, beyond which lay
the phantasmal&mdash;London, the ocean, China, the
Hesperides, Wineland, and all the islands and
all the lands that were in books and dreams.</p>

<p>“The farm-houses of my country, and also
the manor-house, stood on either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
brook, low down. There was a mill and a
chain of ponds, hardly a mile from the source.
Both the ponds and the running water were
bordered thickly with sedge, which was the
home of birds far more often heard than seen.</p>

<p>“The brook wound among little hills which
were also intersected by rough roads, green lanes,
footpaths, and deserted trackways, watery, and
hollow and dark. As the roads never went
on level ground all were more or less deeply
worn, and the overhanging beeches above and
the descending naked roots made them like
groves in a forest. When a road ran into
another or crossed it there was a farm. The
house itself was of grey-white stone, roofed with
tiles; the barn and sheds, apparently tumbling
but never tumbledown, were of dark boards
and thatch, and surrounded by a disorderly
region of nettles, remains of old buildings and
walls, small ponds either black in the shadow
of quince bushes, or emerald with duck-weed,
and a few big oaks or walnuts where the cart-horses
and their foals and a young bull or two
used to stand. A moorhen was sure to be
swimming across the dark pond with a track
of ripples like a peacock’s tail shining behind it.
Fowls scuttered about or lay dusting themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
in the middle of the road, while a big black-tailed
cock perched crowing on a plough handle
or a ruined shed. A cock without a head or a
running fox stood up or drooped on the roof for
a weather-vane, but recorded only the wind of
some long past year which had finally disabled
it. The walls of outhouses facing the road were
garrulous with notices of sales and fairs to be
held shortly or held years ago.</p>

<p>“At a point where one lane ran into another,
as it were on an island, the inn with red blinds
on its four windows looked down the road.
The inn-keeper was a farmer by profession,
but every day drank as much as he sold, except
on a market or fair day. On an ordinary day
I think he was always either looking down
the road for someone to come and drink with
him, or else consoling himself inside for lack
of company. He seemed to me a nice man,
but enormous; I always wondered how his
clothes contained him; yet he could sit on the
mower or tosser all day long in the June sun
when he felt inclined. On a market or fair
day there would be a flock of sheep or a lot
of bullocks waiting outside while the drover
smoked half a pipe and drank by the open door.
And then the landlord was nowhere to be seen:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
I suppose he was at the market or up in the
orchard. For it was the duty of his wife, a
little mousy woman with mousy eyes, to draw
the beer when a customer came to sit or stand
among the empty barrels that filled the place.
It was Called ‘The Crown.’ They said it had
once been ‘The Crown and Cushion,’ but the
cushion was so hard to paint, and no one knew
why a crown should be cushioned or a cushion
crowned, and it was such a big name for the
shanty, that it was diminished to ‘The Crown.’
But it had those four windows with crimson
blinds, and the landlady was said to be a Gypsy
and was followed wherever she went by a white-footed
black cat that looked as if it was really
a lady from a far country enchanted into a cat.
The Gypsy was a most Christian body. She
used to treat with unmistakeable kindness,
whenever he called at the inn, a gentleman
who was notoriously an atheist and teetotaler.
When asked upbraidingly why, she said: ‘He
seems a nice gentleman, and as he is going to a
place where there won’t be many comforts, I
think we ought to do our best to make this
world as happy as possible for him.’</p>

<p>“Opposite to the inn was a carpenter’s shop,
full of windows, and I remember seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
carpenter once at midnight there, working at
a coffin all alone in the glare in the middle of
the blackness. He was a mysterious man.
He never touched ale. He had a soft face with
silky grizzled hair and beard, large eyes, kind
and yet unfriendly, and strange gentle lips as
rosy as a pretty girl’s. I had an extraordinary
reverence for him due to his likeness to a picture
at home of the greatest of the sons of carpenters.
He was tall and thin, and walked like an over-grown
boy. Words were rare with him. I do
not think he ever spoke to me, and this silence
and his ceaseless work&mdash;and especially that one
midnight task&mdash;fascinated me. So I would
stare for an hour at a time at him and
his work, my face against the window, without
his ever seeming to notice me at all.
He had two dogs, a majestic retriever named
Ruskin who was eighteen years old, and a little
black and white mongrel named Jimmy; and
the two accompanied him and ignored one
another. One day as I was idling along towards
the shop, smelling one of those clusters
of wild carrot seeds, like tiny birds’ nests, which
are scented like a ripe pear sweeter and juicier
than ever grew on pear-tree, the carpenter came
out with a gun under one arm and a spade under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
the other and went a short distance down the
road and then into a field which belonged to
him. I followed. No sooner had I begun to
look over the gate than the carpenter lifted his
gun and pointed it at the retriever who had his
back turned and was burying a bone in a corner
of the field. The carpenter fired, the old dog
fell in a heap with blood running out of his
mouth, and Jimmy burst out of the hedge,
snatched the bone, and disappeared. If it had
been anyone but the carpenter I should have
thought this murder a presumptuous and cruel
act; his face and its likeness taught me that
it was a just act; and that, more than anything
else, made justice inseparable in my mind
from pain and intolerable mystery. I was
overawed, and watched him from the moment
when he began to dig until all that was mortal
of the old dog was covered up. It seems he
had been ill and a burden to himself for a long
time. I thought it unjust that he should have
been shot when his back was turned, and this
question even drowned my indignation at the
mongrel’s insolence.</p>

<p>“I knew most of the farmers and labourers,
and they were and are as distinct in my mind
as the kings of England. They were local men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
with names so common in the churchyard that
for some time I supposed it was a storehouse,
rather than a resting-place, of farmers and
labourers. They took small notice of me, and
I was never tired of following them about the
fields, ploughing, mowing, reaping, and in the
milking sheds, in the orchards and the copses.
Nothing is more attractive to children than a
man going about his work with a kindly but
complete indifference to themselves. It is a
mistake to be always troubling to show interest
in them, whether you feel it or not. I remember
best a short, thick, dark man, with a face like
a bulldog’s, broader than it was long, the under-lip
sticking out and up and suggesting great
power and fortitude. Yet it was also a kind
face, and when he was talking I could not
take my eyes off it, smiling as it was kneaded
up into an enormous smile, and watching the
stages of the process by which it was smoothed
again. When he was on his deathbed his son,
who was a tailor, used to walk over every evening
from the town for a gossip. The son had a
wonderful skill in mimicry, and a store of tales
to employ it, but at last the old man, shedding
tears of laughter, had to beg him not to tell
his best stories because laughing hurt so much.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
He died of cancer. No man could leave that
neighbourhood and not be missed in a hundred
ways; I missed chiefly this man’s smile, which
I could not help trying to reproduce on my own
face long afterwards. But nobody could forget
him, even had there been no better reasons,
because after he died his house was never again
occupied. A labourer cultivated the garden,
but the house was left, and the vine leaves
crawled in at the broken windows and spread
wanly into the dark rooms. A storm tumbled
the chimney through the roof. No ghost was
talked of. The house was part of his mortal
remains decaying more slowly than the rest.
The labourer in the garden never pruned the
vine or the apple-trees, or touched the flower
borders. He was a wandering, three-quarter-witted
fellow who came from nowhere and had
no name but Tom. His devotion to the old
man had been like a dog’s. Friends or relatives
or home of his own he had none, or could remember
none. In fact, he had scarce any
memory; when anything out of his past life
came by chance into his head, he rushed to tell
his master and would repeat it for days with
pride and for fear of losing it, as he invariably
did. One of these memories was a nonsensical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
rigmarole of a song which he tried to sing, but
it was no more singing than talking, and resembled
rather the whimper of a dog in its
sleep; it had to do with a squire and a Welshman,
whose accent and mistaken English might alone
have made the performance black mystery.
They tried to get his ‘real’ name out of him,
but he knew only Tom. Asked who gave it to
him, he said it was Mr Road, a former employer,
a very cruel man whom he did not like telling
about. They asked him if he was ever confirmed.
‘No,’ he said, ‘they tried, but I could
not confirm.’ He would do anything for his
master, rise at any hour of the night though he
loved his bed, and go anywhere. Summer or
Winter, he would not sleep in a house, but in a
barn. Except his master’s in the last illness,
he would not enter any house. He was fond
of beer in large quantities, but if he got drunk
with it he was ashamed of himself, and might
go off and not return for months: then one day
he would emerge from the barn, shaking himself
and smiling an awkward twisted smile and
as bashful as a baby. What a place this modern
world is for a man like that, now. I do not like
to think he is still alive in it. All the people
who could understand him are in the workhouse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
or the churchyard. The churchyard is the only
place where he would be likely to stay long.
No prison, asylum, or workhouse, could have
kept him alive for many days.</p>

<p>“The church was like a barn except that it was
nearly always empty, and only mice ever played
in it. Though I went to it every Sunday I
never really got over my dislike of the parson,
which began in terror. He was the only man
in the country who invariably wore black
from top to toe. One hot, shining day I was
playing in a barn, and the doors were open, so
that I saw a field of poppies making the earth
look as if it had caught fire in the sun; the
swallows were coming in and out, and I was
alone, when suddenly a black man stood in
the sunny doorway. The swallows dashed and
screamed at him angrily, and I thought that
they would destroy themselves, for they returned
again and again to within an inch of him.
I could not move. He stood still, then with a
smile and a cough he went away without having
said a word. The next time I saw him was in
the churchyard, when I was about five, and had
not yet begun to attend the Church; in fact I
had never entered it to my knowledge. The
nurse-girl wheeled me up to the churchyard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
wall and stopped at the moment when the black
man appeared out of the church. Behind him
several men were carrying a long box between
them on their shoulders, and they also were in
complete black, and after them walked men,
women, and children, in black; one of the older
women was clinging convulsively to a stiff young
man. When they had all stopped, the parson
coughed and muttered something, which was
followed by a rustling and a silence; the woman
clinging to the young man sobbed aloud, and
her hair fell all over her cheeks like rain.
The nurse-girl had been chatting with a few
passers-by who were watching outside the wall,
but as I saw the woman’s hair fall I began to
cry and I was hurried away. Through the
lych-gate I saw a hole in the ground and everyone
looking down into it as if they had lost
something. At this I stopped crying and asked
the girl what they were looking for; but she
only boxed my ears and I cried again. When at
last she told me that there was a man ‘dead’
in the box, and that they had put him into
the ground, I felt sure that the black man was
in some way the cause of the trouble. I remembered
the look he had given me at the barn
door, and the cough. I was filled with wonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that no one had attempted to rescue the ‘dead,’
and then with fear and awe at the power of the
black man. Whenever I saw him in the lane
I ran away, he was so very black. Nor was the
white surplice ever more than a subterfuge to
make him like the boys in the choir, while his
unnatural voice, praying or preaching, sounded
as if it came up out of the hole in the ground
where the ‘dead’ had been put away.</p>

<p>“How glad I was always, to be back home from
the church; though dinner was ready I walked
round the garden, touching the fruit-trees one
by one, stopping a minute in a corner where I
could be unseen and yet look at the house and
the thick smoke pouring out of the kitchen
chimney. Then I rushed in and kissed my
mother. The rest of the day was very still, no
horses or carts going by, no sound of hoes, only
the cows passing to the milkers. My father
and my mother were both very silent on that
day, and I felt alone and never wanted to stray
far; if it was fine I kept to the garden and
orchard; if wet, to the barn. The day seems in
my memory to have always been either sunny
or else raining with roars of wind in the woods
on the hills; and I can hear the sound, as if it
had been inaudible on other days, of wind and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
rain in the garden trees. If I climbed up into
the old cherry-tree that forked close to the
ground I could be entirely hidden, and I used
to fancy myself alone in the world, and kept
very still and silent lest I should be found out.
But I gave up climbing the tree after the day
when I found Mrs Partridge there before me. I
never made out why she was up there, so quiet.</p>

<p>“Mrs Partridge was a labourer’s wife who came
in two or three days a week to do the rough work.
I did not like her because she was always
bustling about with a great noise and stir, and
she did not like me because I was a spoilt, quiet
child. She was deferential to all of us, and
called me ‘Sir’; but if I dared to touch the
peel when she was baking, or the bees-wax that
she rubbed her irons on when she was ironing,
she talked as if she were queen or I were naught.
While she worked she sang in a coarse, high-pitched
voice or tried to carry on a conversation
with my mother, though she might be up in the
orchard. She was a little woman with a brown
face and alarming glittering eyes. She was
thickly covered with clothes, and when her
skirts were hoisted up to her knees, as they
usually were, she resembled a partridge. She
was as quick and plump as a partridge. She ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
instead of walking, her head forward, her hands
full of clothes and clothes-pegs, and her voice
resounding. No boy scrambled over gates or
fences more nimbly. She feared nothing and
nobody. She was harsh to her children, but
when her one-eyed cat ate the Sunday dinner
she could not bear to strike it, telling my mother,
‘I’ve had the poor creature more than seven
years.’ She was full of idioms and proverbs,
and talked better than any man has written
since Cobbett. One of her proverbs has stayed
fantastically in my mind, though I have forgotten
the connection&mdash;‘As one door shuts
another opens.’ It impressed me with great
mystery, and as she said it the house seemed
very dark, and, though it was broad daylight
and summer, I heard the wind howling in the
roof just as it often did at night and on
winter afternoons.</p>

<p>“Mrs Partridge had a husband of her own size,
but with hollowed cheeks the colour of leather.
Though a slight man he had broad shoulders
and arms that hung down well away from his
body, and this, with his bowed stiff legs, gave
him a look of immense strength and stability:
to this day it is hard to imagine that such a
man could die. When I heard his horses going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
by on a summer morning I knew that it was
six o’clock; when I saw them returning I knew
that it was four. He was the carter, and he did
nothing but work, except that once a week he
went into the town with his wife, drank a pint
of ale with her, and helped her to carry back
the week’s provisions. He needed nothing but
work, out of doors, and in the stables, and
physical rest indoors; and he was equally happy
in both. He never said anything to disturb
his clay pipe, though that was usually out.
What he thought about I do not know, and I
doubt if he did; but he could always break off
to address his horses by name, every minute or
two, in mild rebuke or cheerful congratulation,
as much for his own benefit as for theirs, to
remind himself that he had their company. He
had full responsibility for four cart-horses, a
plough, a waggon, and a dung-cart. He cared
for the animals as if they had been his own: if
they were restless at night he also lost his sleep.
Although so busy he was never in haste, and he
had time for everything save discontent. His
wife did all the talking, and he had his way
without taking the pipe out of his mouth. She
also had her own way, in all matters but one.
She was fond of dancing; he was not, and did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
not like to see her dance. When she did so on
one tempting occasion, and confessed it, he
slept the night in the barn and she did not
dance again. There was a wonderful sympathy
between them, and I remember hearing that
when she knew that she was going to have a baby,
it was he and not she that was indisposed.</p>

<p>“Our house was a square one of stone and tiles,
having a porch and a room over it, and all
covered up in ivy, convolvulus, honeysuckle,
and roses, that mounted in a cloud far over the
roof and projected in masses, threatening some
day to pull down all with their weight, but
never trimmed. The cherry-tree stretched out
a long horizontal branch to the eaves at one
side. In front stood two pear-trees, on a piece
of lawn which was as neat as the porch was
wild, and around their roots clustered a thicket
of lilac and syringa, hiding the vegetable-garden
beyond. These trees darkened and cooled the
house, but that did not matter. In no other
house did winter fires ever burn so brightly or
voices sound so sweet; and outside, the sun was
more brilliant than anywhere else, and the
vegetable-garden was always bordered by crimson
or yellow flowers. The road went close by, but it
was a hollow lane, and the heads of the passers-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>by
did not reach up to the bottom of our hedge,
whose roots hung down before caves that were
continually being deepened by frost. This
hedge, thickened by traveller’s joy, bramble,
and ivy, entirely surrounded us; and as it was
high as well as thick you could not look out of
it except at the sky and the hills&mdash;the road,
the neighbouring fields, and all houses being
invisible. The gate, which was reached by a
flight of steps up from the road, was half-barricaded
and all but hidden by brambles and
traveller’s joy, and the unkempt yew-tree saluted
and drenched the stranger&mdash;in one branch a
golden-crested wren had a nest year after year.</p>

<p>“Two trees reigned at the bottom of the garden&mdash;at
one side an apple; at the other, just above
the road, a cypress twice as high as the house,
ending in a loose plume like a black cock’s tail.
The apple-tree was old, and wore as much green
in winter as in summer, because it was wrapped
in ivy, every branch was furry with lichen and
moss, and the main boughs bushy with mistletoe.
Each autumn a dozen little red apples hung on
one of its branches like a line of poetry in a
foreign language, quoted in a book. The thrush
used to sing there first in winter, and usually
sang his last evening song there, if it was a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
evening. Yet the cypress was my favourite. I
thought there was something about it sinister to
all but myself. I liked the smell of it, and when
at last I went to the sea its bitterness reminded
me of the cypress. Birds were continually going
in and out of it, but never built in it. Only one
bird sang in it, and that was a small, sad bird
which I do not know the name of. It sang
there every month of the year, it might be early
or it might be late, on the topmost point of the
plume. It never sang for long, but frequently,
and always suddenly. It was black against
the sky, and I saw it nowhere else. The song
was monotonous and dispirited, so that I fancied
it wanted us to go, because it did not like the
cheerful garden, and my father’s loud laugh,
and my mother’s tripping step: I fancied it
was up there watching the clouds and very
distant things in hope of a change; but nothing
came, and it sang again, and waited, ever in
vain. I laughed at it, and was not at all sorry
to see it there, for it had stood on that perch in
all the happy days before, and so long as it
remained the days would be happy. My father
did not like the bird, but he was often looking
at it, and noted its absence as I did. The day
after my sister died he threw a stone at it&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
one time I saw him angry&mdash;and killed it. But
a week later came another, and when he heard
it he burst into tears, and after that he never
spoke of it but just looked up to see if it was
there when he went in or out of the porch. We
had taller trees in the neighbourhood, such as
the wych-elms and the poplars by the brook,
but this was a solitary stranger and could be seen
several miles away like a black pillar, as the
old cherry could in blossom-time, like a white
dome. You were seldom out of sight of it. It
was a station for any bird flying to or from the
hills. A starling stopped a minute, piped and
flew off. The kestrel was not afraid to alight
and look around. The nightjar used it. At
twilight it was encircled by midges, and the
bats attended them for half an hour. Even by
day it had the sinister look which was not
sinister to me: some of the night played truant
and hid in it throughout the sunshine. Often
I could see nothing, when I looked out of my
window, but the tree and the stars that set
round it, or the mist from the hills. What
with this tree, and the fruit-trees, and the
maples in the hedge, and the embowering of
the house, I think the birds sometimes forgot
the house. In the mornings, in bed, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
every colour on the woodpigeon, and the ring
on his neck, as he flew close by without swerving.
At breakfast my father would say, ‘There’s a
kestrel.’ We looked up and saw nothing, but
on going to the window, there was the bird
hovering almost above us. I suppose its shadow
or its blackening of the sky made him aware
of it before he actually saw it.</p>

<p>“Next to us&mdash;on still days we heard the soft
bell rung in the yard there at noon&mdash;was the
manor-house, large, but unnoticeable among its
trees. I knew nothing about the inside of it,
but I went all over the grounds, filled my pockets
with chestnuts, got a peach now and then from
the gardener, picked up a peacock’s feather.
Wonderfully beautiful ladies went in and out
of that old house with the squire. A century
back he would have been a pillar of the commonwealth:
he was pure rustic English, and his
white hair and beard had an honourable look
as if it had been granted to him for some rare
service; no such beards are to be found now in
country-houses. I do not know what he did:
I doubt if there is anything for such a man to
do to-day except sit for his portrait to an
astonished modern painter. I think he knew men
as well as horses; at least he knew everyone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
in that country, had known them all when he
and they were boys. He was a man as English,
as true to the soil, as a Ribston pippin.</p>

<p>“The woods on the hills were his, or at least
such rights as anybody had in them were his.
As for me, I got on very well in them with no
right at all. Now, home and the garden were
so well known, so safe, and so filled with us,
that they seemed parts of us, and I only crept
a little deeper into the core when I went to bed
at night, like a worm in a big sweet apple. But
the woods on the hills were utterly different,
and within them you could forget that there
was anything in the world but trees and yourself,
an insignificant self, so wide and solitary were
they. The trees were mostly beeches and yews,
massed closely together. Nothing could grow
under them. Except for certain natural sunny
terraces not easily found, they covered the whole
hills from top to bottom, even in the steepest
parts where you could slide, run, and jump the
whole distance down&mdash;about half a mile&mdash;in
two minutes. The soil was dead branches and
dead leaves of beech and yew. Many of the
trees were dead: the stumps stood upright
until they were so rotten that I could overturn
them with a touch. Others hung slanting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
among the boughs of their companions, or were
upheld by huge cables of honeysuckle or
traveller’s joy which had once climbed up them
and flowered over their crests. Many had
mysterious caverns at their roots, and as it were
attic windows high up where the owls nested.
The earth was a honeycomb of rabbits’ burrows
and foxes’ earths among the bony roots of the
trees, some of them stuffed with a century of
dead leaves.</p>

<p>“Where the slope was least precipitous or had
a natural ledge, two or three tracks for timber-carriages
had once been made. But these had
not been kept up, and were not infallible even
as footpaths. They were, however, most useful
guides to the terraces, where the sun shone and
I could see the cypress and my mother among
the sunflowers, and the far-away hills.</p>

<p>“On my ninth birthday they gave me an old
horn that had been a huntsman’s, and when I
was bold and the sun was bright, I sometimes
blew it in the woods, trembling while the echoes
roamed among the gulfs which were hollowed
in the hillsides, and my mother came out into
the little garden far off. During the autumn
and winter the huntsman blew his horn in the
woods often for a whole day together. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
root caves and old earths gave the fox more than
a chance. The horses were useless. The hounds
had to swim rather than run in perpetual dead
leaves. If I saw the fox I tried hard not to
shout and betray him, but the temptation was
very strong to make the echo, for I was proud
of my halloo, and I liked to see the scarlet coats,
the lordly riders and the pretty ladies, and to
hear the questing hound and horn, and the
whips calling Ajax, Bravery, Bannister, Fury
Nell, and the rest. Then at last I was glad to
see the pack go by at the day’s end, with sleepy
heads, taking no notice of me and waving tails
that looked clever as if they had eyes and ears in
them, and to hear the clatter of horses dying round
the end of the crescent into the outer world.</p>

<p>“Nobody took heed of the woods except the
hunters. The timber was felled if at all by the
west wind. The last keeper had long ago left
his thatched cottage under the hill, where the
sun shone so hot at midday on the reed-thatched
shed and the green mummy of a stoat hanging
on the wall. So I met nobody in the woods.
I took an axe there day after day for a week
and chopped a tree half through, unmolested
except by the silence, which, however, wore me
out with its protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“The woods ended at the top in a tangle of
thorns, and it was there I saw my first fox. I
was crawling among some brambles, amusing
myself with biting off the blackberries, when a
fox jumped up out of a tuft and faced me, his
eyes on the level with mine. I was pleased as
well as startled, never took my eyes off him, and
presently began to crawl forward again. But
at this the fox flashed his teeth at me with a
snap, and was off before I could think of anything
to say. High above these thorns stood
four Scotch firs, forming a sort of gateway by
which I usually re-entered the woods. Gazing
up their tall stems that moved slowly and
softly like a grasshopper’s horns, as if they were
breathing, I took my last look at the sky before
plunging under beech and yew. There were
always squirrels in one of them, chasing one
another clattering up and down the bark, or
chattering at me, close at hand, as if their nerves
were shattered with surprise and indignation.
When they had gone out of sight I began to run&mdash;faster
and faster, running and sliding down with
a force that carried me over the meadow at the
foot, and across the road to the steps and home.
I had ten years in that home and in those woods.
Then my father died; I went to school; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
entered an office. Those ten years were reality.
Everything since has been scarcely more real
than the world was when it was still cut off by
the hills across the valley, and I looked lazily
towards it from under the cypress where the
little bird sang. There is nothing to rest on,
nothing to make a man last like the old men I
used to see in cottage gardens or at gateways
in the valley of the Uther.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr Morgan once, “I don’t often
agree with Mr Torrance, but I am very glad he
exists.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smaller">MR STODHAM, THE RESPECTABLE MAN,
AND THE DRYAD</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">To Mr Stodham, I think, Mr Torrance’s books
were the man. He&mdash;perhaps he alone in
England&mdash;possessed a full set of the thirty-three
volumes produced by Mr Torrance under
his own name in thirteen years. “It is wonderful,”
said Ann once, “that the dancing of a
pen over a sheet of paper can pay the rent and
the baker’s bill, and it hardly seems right.
But, still, it appears there are people born that
can do nothing else, and they must live like
the rest of us.... And I will say that Mr
Torrance is one of the best of us, though he
has that peculiarity.”</p>

<p>Mr Stodham could not trust himself to speak.
He really liked Ann: furthermore, he knew that
she was wiser than he: finally, everyone at that
moment had something better to think of, because
Jack and Roland had put on the gloves. Mr
Stodham, consequently, quoted George Borrow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“There’s the wind on the heath, brother; if
I could only feel that, I would gladly live for
ever. Dosta, we’ll now go to the tents and put
on the gloves; and I’ll try to make you feel
what a sweet thing it is to be alive, brother.”</p>

<p>Jack overheard him, and at the end of the
round said, “What was that, Mr Stodham?
say it again.” When the words of Jasper had
been repeated, “Jolly good,” said Jack, “but
what puzzles me is how a man who knew that
could bother to write a book. There must have
been something the matter with him. Perhaps
he didn’t really believe what he wrote.”
And so they had another round.</p>

<p>Mr Stodham liked everything at Abercorran
House. Liking was his chief faculty, and there
it had unstinted exercise. Probably he liked
the very wife whom he escaped by going either
to the country or to Abercorran House. An
accident had first brought him among the
Morgans. One day as he happened to be
passing down the farm lane a child threw a ball
unintentionally over into the Wilderness. After
it went Mr Stodham in an instant, not quite
missing the nails at the top of the fence. The
long grass of the Wilderness and his own bad
sight kept the ball hidden until the child went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
away in despair, unknown to him, for he continued
the search. There perhaps he would
have been searching still, if the Wilderness had
not been built over, and if Roland had not come
along and found man and ball almost in the
same moment. Here the matter could not end.
For Mr Stodham, unawares, had been reduced
by a nail in the fence to a condition which the
public does not tolerate. It seems that he
offered to wait for nightfall when Roland had
pointed out his misfortune. He was stubborn,
to the verge of being abject, in apologising for
his presence, and, by implication, for his existence,
and in not wishing to cause any trouble
to Roland or the family. Gently but firmly
Roland lured him upstairs and gave him a pair
of trousers beyond reproach. On the following
day when he reappeared, bearing the trousers
and renewed apologies, the family, out in the
yard, was in full parliament assembled. He
made a little speech, cheered by everyone but
Higgs. Presumably he was so fascinated by
the scene that the cheering did not disconcert
him. He could not get away, especially as his
stick had been seized by Spot the fox-terrier,
who was now with apparently no inconvenience
to himself, being whirled round and round on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the end of it by Jack. Ann came out with his
own trousers thoroughly reformed, and she had
to be thanked. Lastly, Mr Morgan carried him
off before the stick had been recovered. Next
day, therefore, he had to come again in search
of the stick, a priceless favourite before Spot
had eaten it. Mr Morgan consoled him and
cemented the acquaintance by giving him an
ash stick with a handle formed by Nature in the
likeness of a camel’s head. Mr Morgan said
that the stick had been cut on Craig-y-Dinas&mdash;the
very place where the ash stick was cut, which
a certain Welshman was carrying on London
Bridge when he was espied by a magician, who
asked to be taken to the mother tree, which in
as long as it takes to walk three hundred miles
was done, with the result that a cave was found
on Craig-y-Dinas, full of treasure which was
guarded by King Arthur and his knights, who
were, however, sleeping a sleep only to be disturbed
by a certain bell, which the Welshman
by ill luck did ring, with the predicted result,
that the king and his knights rose up in their
armour and so terrified him that he forgot
the word which would have sent them to sleep
again, and he dropped all his treasure, ran for
his life, and could never more find cave, stick, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
magician for all his seeking. Mr Stodham
responded in a sententious pretty speech, saying
in effect that with such a stick he needed no
other kind of treasure than those it would inevitably
conduct him to&mdash;the hills, rivers, woods,
and meadows of the home-counties, and some
day, he hoped, to Craig-y-Dinas itself.</p>

<p>Thus Mr Stodham came again and again, to
love, honour, and obey the ways of Abercorran
House, just as he did the entirely different ways
of Mrs Stodham’s house. He, and no other,
taught Philip the way to that piece of country
which became ours. Harry and Lewis, still
under ten, awakened in him a faculty for spinning
yarns. What they were nobody but those three
knew; for the performance was so special and
select that the two boys formed the sole audience.
They revealed nothing of what enchanted them.
Or was there anything more than at first appeared
in Harry’s musing remark on being questioned
about Mr Stodham’s stories: “Mr Stodham’s
face is like a rat,” a remark which was accompanied
by a nibbling grimace which caused
smiles of recognition and some laughter?
“Yes,” added Lewis, penitent at the laughter
he had provoked, “a <i>very good</i> rat!” Perhaps
the shy, sandy man’s shrunken face was worked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
up to an unwonted&mdash;and therefore comical&mdash;freedom
of expression in the excitement of these
tales, and this fascinated the boys and made
them his firm supporters. He was a tall, thin,
sandy-haired, sandy-bearded man with spectacles.
As if tobacco smoke had mummified him, his
face was of a dried yellow. He stooped slightly
and walked rapidly with long strides. Nobody
had professed to find anything great or good
in him, yet several different kinds of men spoke
of him with liking as well as pity. If there was
something exceptional about this most ordinary
man, it was his youthfulness. It had been said
that he was too dull to grow old. But youthful
he was, though it is hard to say how, since he
truly was dull, and if he had not been indolent
must have been a bore&mdash;but he was too modest
for anyone to allow him to bore. As you
walked behind him you had little doubt of
his youthfulness. Something in the loose-jointed
lightness and irresponsibility of his gait
suggested a boy, and if you had been following
him with this thought, and he turned round
to greet you, the wrinkled, smoky face was a
great surprise. There was something in his
nature corresponding to this loose-jointed walk.
The dogs, I think, knew it: they could do what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
they liked with him, and for them he carried
sugar as a regular cargo.</p>

<p>Thus, Mr Stodham began to be interwoven
with that fellowship. I was perhaps too old
for his romantic tales, but I have heard him
telling Mr Morgan what he considered interesting
in his own life. Whatever it was, it revealed
his shyness, or his excitability, or his innocence.
Once he gave a long explanation of how he came
to set an uncommon value on a certain book
which he was lending to Mr Morgan. Some
winters before, something caused him to wake
at midnight and sit up to listen, in spite of the
usual powerful inclination to sleep again. At
a sharp noise on the pane he threw up the
window. All the flints of the road were clear
in an unusual light. The white face of a policeman
was looking up at him, and he heard the
words “Fire!... Come down.” Rapidly
half dressing as if executing an order which he
did not understand, he was outside on the
pavement in a minute. It was next door.
The building was losing all resemblance to a
barber’s shop; like mad birds the flames flew
across it and out at the shuttered windows.
The policeman was hammering at the door, to
waken those who were in their beds above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
fire. Heavily they slept, and some minutes
passed before a man came down carrying an
umbrella, a woman arranging her hair. The
shriek of a cat followed them out of the door,
but so also did the flames. Soon the shop was
an oblong box containing one great upright
body of fire, through which could be seen the
twisted skeleton remains of iron bedsteads.
Quietly the street had become packed with
onlookers&mdash;curious neighbours, passers-by, and
a few night-wanderers who had souls above
merely keeping warm by standing against the
walls of bakeries. There were three fire engines.
With a low hum the jets of water yielded themselves
to the fire and were part of it. Suddenly
a fireman noticed that Mr Stodham’s own window
was lit from within, thought that the flames
had penetrated so far, and was about to direct
the hose on it when Mr Stodham shook off the
charm of the tumultuous glare to explain that
he had left a lamp burning. The man went
with him into the house, but could find no fire.
Left alone in his room Mr Stodham noticed that
it was hot, pleasantly hot for a January midnight.
The wall that he leaned against was
pleasant until he remembered the fire on the
other side. He made haste to save his papers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Instead of sorting them roughly there, he proposed
to remove, not the separate drawers,
but the whole desk. He forgot that it had only
entered the house, in the first place, after having
the castors detached, and omitting to do this
now, he wedged it firmly between the walls and
so barricaded the main passage of the house.
He took out all the contents of all the drawers,
deposited them with a neighbour whom he
had never before seen. Then he returned to his
room. He was alone with his books, and had
to choose among them, which he should take
and save. They numbered several hundred,
including a shelf of the very first books he had
read to himself. A large proportion consisted
of the books of his youth. Having been lived
through by the eager, docile Stodham, these
poems, romances, essays, autobiographies, had
each a genuine personality, however slight the
difference of its cover from its neighbour’s.
Another class represented aspirations, regrets,
oblivions: half cut, dustier than the rest,
these wore strange, sullen, ironical, or actually
hostile looks. Some had been bought because
it was inevitable that a young man should have
a copy. Others, chiefly volumes in quarto or
folio, played something like the parts of family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
portraits in a house of one of the new-rich. An
unsuspecting ostentation had gone with some
affection to their purchase. They gave a hint
of “the dark backward and abysm of time” to
that small room, dingy but new.... He
leaned against the hot wall, receiving their
various looks, returning them. Several times
he bent forward to clutch this one or that, but
saw another which he could not forsake for it,
and so left both. He moved up close to the
rows: he stood on tip-toe, he knelt. Some
books he touched, others he opened. He put
each one back. The room was silent with
memory. He might have put them all in safety
by this time. The most unexpected claims
were made. For example, there was a black-letter
“Morte d’Arthur” in olive calf. He had
paid so much for it that he had to keep its
existence secret: brown paper both concealed
and protected it. He did, in fact, put this
with a few others, chosen from time to time,
on a chair. Only a very few were without
any claims&mdash;histories and the like, of which
there are thousands of copies, all the same. The
unread and never-to-be-read volumes put in
claims unexpectedly. No refusal could be made
without a qualm. He looked at the select<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
pile on the chair dissatisfied. Rather than
take them only he would go away empty. “You
had better look sharp, sir,” said a fireman,
vaulting over the desk. Mr Stodham looked at
the mute multitude of books and saw all in a
flash. Nevertheless not one could he make up
his mind to rescue. But on the mantelpiece
lay a single book until now unnoticed&mdash;a small
eighteenth century book in worn contemporary
binding, an illustrated book of travels in Africa
by a Frenchman&mdash;which he had long ago paid
twopence for and discontinued his relations
with it. He swiftly picked up this book and
was, therefore, able to lend it to Mr Morgan for
the sake of the plates. But after all he saved
all his other books also. The fire did not reach
his house, and the one thing damaged was the
desk which the firemen had to leap on to and
over in passing through to the back of the
house.</p>

<p>Mr Stodham, in spite of professing a poor
opinion of the subject, was delighted in his quiet
way to speak of himself. He was at this time
a nearly middle-aged clerk, disappointed in a
tranquil style, and beginning to regard it as
something to his credit that when he had been
four years married he had talked a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
of going to the colonies. If only he had gone&mdash;his
imagination was unequal to the task of
seeing what might have happened if only he
had gone. The regret or pretence of it gave
him a sort of shadowy grandeur by suggesting
that it was from a great height he had fallen to
his present position in a suburban maisonette.
Here by some means he had secured to himself
the exclusive rights to a little room known as
“The Study.” This room was narrower than
it was high, and allowed no more than space
for his table between the two walls of books,
when he sat facing the French window, with
the door behind. He looked out on a pink
almond-tree, and while this flowered he could see
nothing else but the tree and the south-east
sky above it; at other seasons the hind parts
of many houses like his own were unmistakeable.
At night a green blind was let down over
the window before the lamp was lit. In this
room, and in no other place but Abercorran
House, he was at home. Seated at that table,
smoking, he felt equal to anything with which
his wife or the world could afflict him. He
desired no change in the room, beyond a slowly
increasing length to accommodate his increasing
books. He would have liked to open the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
windows more often than, being of the French
pattern, was deemed safe. The room was
completely and unquestionably his own. For
his wife it was too shabby and too much out of
her influence; she would not take her fingers
from the door-handle when she had to enter
it. His children were stiff and awed in it,
because in earlier days he had been strict in
demanding silence in its neighbourhood. Much
as he wished that they would forget the old
rule they could not; he liked to see them standing
at the door looking towards him and the
window, but they made haste to be off. As
to the servant, she dreaded being caught in the
room since the mistress had commanded her to
dust it daily, and the master to leave it to him.</p>

<p>Mr Morgan, Mr Torrance, and in later years
myself, he admitted to the Study. Acquaintances
he received with his wife in their clean
and expensive drawing-room. Husband and
wife were in harmony when entertaining a few
of those whom Mrs Stodham called their friends.
On these rare occasions the defensive combination
of her slightly defiant pride and his kindly
resignation was a model of unconscious tact.
If there was a man&mdash;which seldom came about&mdash;Mr
Stodham would ask him into the Study.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
The gas was slowly lighted, the gas-stove more
slowly or not at all. The intruder would remark
what a lot of books there were, and how he
never had any time for reading. There was
only one chair, and he was compelled to sit in
it and to light a cigarette. Mr Stodham himself
was loth to smoke there in profane company,
but dallied with an unaccustomed cigarette,
or, if he took a pipe, soon rapped out on the
stove with it some variation upon the theme of
discontent. In either case his gentle but disturbed
presence hung oppressively on the visitor,
who very soon took the hint from that helpless
but determined face, to propose a return to the
drawing-room. There Mrs Stodham frequently
made the remark: “What a lot of books
John has,” nodding complacently and with the
implication partly that she despised them,
partly that she saw their worth as a family
distinction. At the end of such an evening or
after any unpleasantness Mr Stodham would
go into the Study, stick an unlit pipe between
his teeth, open a book and read very slowly,
stretching his legs out, for five minutes, then
sigh, stand up and look along the rows of
books without seeing them, and go up to bed
before he had defined his dissatisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>The Study was the scene of the most extraordinary
thing he had to relate. Once when
he had been lying for several days in bed, weak
and fevered, he had a strong desire to go downstairs
to the Study. Darkness and tea-time
were near, his wife and children were out,
doubtless the servant was reading something
by the light of the red-hot kitchen grate. The
house was silent. Slowly the invalid went
down and laid his fingers on the handle of his
door, which was opposite the foot of the stairs.
An unusual feeling of quiet expectancy had
stolen on him; nothing, he said, could have
astonished him at that moment. He had,
however, no idea of what he was expecting until
he had opened the door to its full extent. Thus
was disclosed, between his table and the window,
a beautiful female figure, half sitting, half reclining,
as if asleep, among a number of books
which had remained on the floor during his illness.
Though he had not put on his spectacles
before coming down he saw perfectly, so clearly,
as he said, that she seemed to gleam, as if it was
still full day with her. Her beautiful long
black hair was confined by a narrow fillet of
gold, which made clear the loveliness of her
head. He said that only Mr Torrance could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
describe her properly. No, he affirmed, if
people smiled, it did not occur to him that the
nude looked awkward near a gas-stove. Nor had
she any more need of its warmth than the Elgin
Marbles or the Bacchus in Titian’s “Bacchus
and Ariadne.” Yet she was not of marble or
paint, but of flesh, though he had seen nothing
of the kind in his life. Her shoulders moved
with her breathing, and this as well as her
attitude proclaimed that she was mourning,
some seconds before he heard her sob. He
thought that the figure and posture were the
same as those in a Greek statue which he had
seen long before, in London or Paris. They had
the remoteness and austerity of marble along
with something delicate, transient, and alive.
But if there could have been a doubt whether
she was flesh or stone, there was none that she
was divine. In what way she was divine he
could not tell, but certainly she was, though
in no visible way was she different from the
women of pictures and statues. He did not
feel that she would notice him. He was not
shocked, or curious, but calm and still expectant.
He drew a deep breath and tried to make his
trembling body stand quite still by leaning
against the wall to watch. He did not suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
that she had come into his room in the ordinary
way. He had, on the other hand, a conviction
that she had something to do with his books,
that she had emerged from them or one of
them. A gap in the bottom shelf, where stood
the largest books, caught his eye and thrust
itself forward as a cave whence she had come.
Yet she was as white as Aphrodite newly risen
from the unsailed ocean, and she diffused a
sense of open air, of space, of the wild pure air,
about her, as if she lay upon a rock at the sea
edge or among mountain flowers instead of in
this narrow room. He concluded in a reasonable
way that she was one of the poets’ nymphs
whom he had so often read of with lazy credulity.
Actually the words ran into his mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Arethusa arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">From her couch of snows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the Acroceraunian mountains&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">From cloud and from crag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">With many a jag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shepherding her bright fountains.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But he did not accept her as the Sicilian
river. Other words crept through his mind,
as of “lorn Urania ... most musical of
mourners,” and of “lost Echo” seated “amid
the voiceless mountains.” Still his brain flew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
on, next causing him to see in her an incarnation
of the morning star, for from brow to foot she
was very bright. But he came back again to
the idea of some goddess, or muse, or grace, or
nymph, or Dryad&mdash;the word Dryad recurring
several times as if by inspiration; and thereafter
he referred to her as the Dryad.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the sound of the door-handle
released some time after the door was closed
that caused her suddenly to become silent and
to raise her sea-gray glittering eyes towards
him. She was gasping for breath. “Air,”
she cried, “Air&mdash;the wide air and light&mdash;air
and light.” Mr Stodham rushed forward past
her and threw open one of the French windows.
She turned towards the air, drinking it with
her lips and also with her hands which opened
and closed with motions like leaves under
water. Mr Stodham could not open the second
window. “Air,” cried the Dryad. So he
thrust steadily and then violently at the frame
with his whole body until the window gave
way, splintering and crashing. Still moving
as if drowning and vainly trying to rise, the
Dryad cried out for more of the air which now
streamed into the Study. By stretching out
her hands now up and now on either side she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
implored to be surrounded by an ocean of air.
To Mr Stodham this was a command. Sideways
with head lowered he leaned heavily against
both walls in turn, struggling to overthrow
them. He strode backwards and forwards along
the bookshelves, striking fiercely here and there
in the hope that the wall would yield and
let in the heavenly air for the Dryad. When
he thought this vain he ran from room to room
throwing open or smashing each window until
all had been done. “More air,” he shouted.
The last room was the drawing-room. Its
windows having been smashed, he set about
doing what he had run out of his study to do.
In the middle of the drawing-room he began to
make a fire. From floor to ceiling the eager
flames leapt at a bound; a widening circle of
carpet smouldered; and Mr Stodham, crouching
low, shivering, holding his hands to the heat,
muttered “More air,” like an incantation.
“The Dryad must have more air. We must
all have more air. Let the clean fire burn down
these walls and all the walls of London. So
there will be more air, and she will be free, all
will be free.” As the carpet began to smoulder
under him he hopped from one foot to another,
not muttering now, but shrieking, “More air,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and at last leaping high as the flames, he ran
straight out into the street. He ran as if he
were trying to escape himself&mdash;which he was;
for his nightgown and dressing-gown flared out
in sparks behind him, and from these he was
running. He twisted and leapt in his race,
as if he had a hope of twisting or leaping out of
the flames....</p>

<p>This scene was regarded by us as humorous&mdash;I
suppose because we knew that Mr Stodham
had survived it&mdash;but by Ann as terrible. She
had a great kindness for Mr Stodham; she
even proposed to deliver him from his wife
by providing him with a room at Abercorran
House: but if he was not content with his
servitude he could not imagine another state....</p>

<p>Probably he fell down unconscious from his
burns and exhaustion: he remembered no
more when many days later the delirium left
him. That he had attempted to set his
house on fire was noted as an extraordinary
frenzy of influenza: Mrs Stodham, suspecting
a malicious motive for starting the fire in her
drawing-room, particularly resented it. Such
portions of the story as he betrayed in his
delirium drove her to accuse him of having a
shameful and disgusting mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>On coming down to the Study from the sick
room again he saw no Dryad. He opened
wide the new French windows, and stood looking
at the dark bole of the almond-tree, slender
and straight, and all its blossom suspended in
one feathery pile against the sky. The airy
marble of the white clouds, the incorporeal
sweetness of the flowers, the space and majesty
of the blue sky, the freshness of the air, each
in turn and all together recalled the Dryad.
He shed tears in an intense emotion which was
neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

<p>Aurelius had a great admiration for Mr
Stodham on the ground that he did not write a
poem about the Dryad. The story appealed
also to Ann. She referred in awe to “Mr
Stodham’s statue.” She said: “There was a
statue in that condition in the church at home.
Some renowned artist carved it for a memorial
to the Earl’s only daughter. But I could not
abide it in the cold, dark, old place. It wanted
to be out under the ash-trees, or in among the
red roses and ferns. I did think it would have
looked best of all by the waterfall. These
statues are a sort of angels, and they don’t seem
natural under a roof with ordinary people. Out
of doors it is different, or it would be, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
I haven’t seen angels or statues out of doors.
But I have seen bathers, and they look as
natural as birds.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Ann,” said Mr Morgan,
“and prettier than birds. The other Sunday
when I was out walking early I found a path
that took me for some way alongside a stream.
There was a Gypsy caravan close to the path,
three or four horses scattered about, an old
woman at the fire, and several of the party in
the water. I hurried on because I saw that the
swimmers were girls. But there was no need
to hurry. Two of them, girls of about fifteen
with coal-black hair, caught sight of me, and
climbed out on to the bank before my eyes
to beg. I walked on quickly to give them a
chance of reconsidering the matter, but it was
no use. Sixpence was the only thing that
would turn them back. I wish now I had not
been so hasty in giving it. The girl put it in
her mouth, after the usual blessing, and ran
back with her companion to the water. They
wanted money as well as air, Stodham. Your
visitor was less alive.”</p>

<p>“For shame, sir,” interjected Ann, “she
was not a Gypsy. She was an honourable
statue, and there is no laugh in the case at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but there is, Ann, and there always
will be a laugh for some one in these matters
so long as some one else chooses to be as solemn
as a judge in public about them, and touchy,
too, Ann. Don’t let us pretend or even try
to be angels. We have not the figure for it.
I think there is still a long future for men and
women, if they have more and more air, and
enough sixpences to let them bathe, for example,
in peace.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” concluded Ann, “but a bit
parsonified, too.” She would have added
something, but could no longer ignore the fact
that close by stood the tall old watercress-man,
Jack Horseman, patiently waiting for the right
moment to touch his hat. His Indian complexion
had come back to the old soldier, he
was slightly tipsy, and he had a bunch of cowslips
in his hat. Mr Morgan disappeared. Ann
went in with the watercress for change. Philip
and I took possession of Jack, to ask if he
had found that blackthorn stick he had often
promised us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smaller">GREEN AND SCARLET</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">One evening Aurelius was telling Mr Stodham
about the “battle of the green and scarlet.”
“It took place in your country,” said he to the
good man, too timid to be incredulous.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Mr Stodham, “I never
heard of it.”</p>

<p>“You shall,” said Aurelius, and told the tale.</p>

<p>“The first thing that I can remember is that
a tall, gaunt man in green broke out of a dark
forest, leaping extravagantly, superhumanly,
but rhythmically, and wildly singing; and
that he was leading an army to victory. As
he carved and painted himself on my mind I
knew without effort what had gone before this
supreme moment.</p>

<p>“It was late afternoon in winter. No light
came from the misted, invisible sky, but the
turf of the bare hill-top seemed of itself to
breathe up a soft illumination. Where this
hill-top may be I know not, but at the time of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
which I am speaking I was on foot in broad
daylight and on a good road in the county of
Hampshire.</p>

<p>“The green man, the extravagant leaper and
wild singer, broke out of the hillside forest at
the head of a green army. His leaping and his
dancing were so magnificent that his followers
might at first have been mistaken for idle
spectators. The enemy came, clad in scarlet,
out of the forest at the opposite side of the hill-top.
The two were advancing to meet upon
a level plateau of smooth, almost olive turf....</p>

<p>“For days and nights the steep hillside forest
had covered the manœuvres of the forces.
Except one or two on each side they had seen
and heard nothing of one another, so dark
were the trees, the mists so dense and of such
confusing motion; and that those few had seen
or heard their enemies could only be guessed,
for they were found dead. Day and night the
warriors saw pale mist, dark trees, darker earth,
and the pale faces of their companions, alive
or dead. What they heard was chiefly the
panting of breathless men on the steeps, but
sometimes also the drip of the sombre crystal
mist-beads, the drenched flight of great birds
and their shrieks of alarm or of resentment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
at the invaders, the chickadeedee of little birds
flitting about them without fear, the singing of
thrushes in thorns at the edges of the glades.</p>

<p>“In the eventless silence of the unknown
forest each army, and the scarlet men more
than the green, had begun to long for the conflict,
if only because it might prove that they were
not lost, forgotten, marooned, in the heart of
the mist, cut off from time and from all humanity
save the ancient dead whose bones lay in the
barrows under the beeches. Therefore it was
with joy that they heard the tread of their
enemies approaching across the plain. When
they could see one another it was to the scarlet
men as if they had sighted home; to the green
men it was as if a mistress was beckoning.
They forgot the endless strange hills, the dark
trees, the curst wizard mist. It no longer
seemed to them that the sheep-bells, bubbling
somewhere out of sight, came from flocks who
were in that world which they had unwillingly
and unwittingly left for ever.</p>

<p>“The scarlet men were very silent; if there
were songs in the heads of two or three, none
sang. They looked neither to left nor to right;
they saw not their fellows, but only the enemy.
The breadth of the plain was very great to them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
With all their solidity they could hardly endure
the barren interval&mdash;it had been planned that
they should wait for the charge, but it was felt
now that such a pause might be too much for
them. Ponderous and stiff, not in a straight
line, nor in a curve, nor with quite natural
irregularity, but in half a dozen straight lines
that never made one, they came on, like rocks
moving out against the tide. I noticed that
they were modern red-coats armed with rifles,
their bayonets fixed.</p>

<p>“The green men made a curved irregular front
like the incoming sea. They rejoiced separately
and together in these minutes of approach.
And they sang. Their song was one which the
enemy took to be mournful because it had in
it the spirit of the mountain mists as well as of
the mountains. It saddened the hearts of the
enemy mysteriously; the green men themselves
it filled, as a cup with wine, with the certainty
of immortality. They turned their eyes frequently
towards their nearest companions, or
they held their heads high, so that their gaze
did not take in the earth or anything upon it.
The enemy they scarcely saw. They saw chiefly
their leaping leader and his mighty twelve.</p>

<p>“The first love of the scarlet men for the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
had either died, or had turned into hate, fear,
indignation, or contempt. There may have
been joy among them, but all the passions of
the individuals were blended into one passion&mdash;if
such it could be called&mdash;of the mass, part
contempt for the others, part confidence in
themselves. But among the green men first
love had grown swiftly to a wild passion of joy.</p>

<p>“The broad scarlet men pushed forward
steadily.</p>

<p>“The tall green hero danced singing towards
them. His men leaped after him&mdash;first a
company of twelve, who might have been his
brethren; then the whole green host, lightly
and extravagantly. The leader towered like
a fountain of living flame. Had he stood still
he must have been gaunt and straight like a
beech-tree that stands alone on the crest of a
sea-beholding hill. He was neither young nor
old&mdash;or was he both young and old like the gods?
In his blue eyes burnt a holy and joyous fire.
He bore no weapon save a dagger in his right
hand, so small that to the enemy he appeared
unarmed as he leaped towards them. First he
hopped, then he leaped with one leg stretched
forward and very high, and curved somewhat
in front of the other, while at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
the arm on the opposite side swung across his
body. But, in fact, whenever I looked at him&mdash;and
I saw chiefly him&mdash;he was high in the air,
with his head uplifted and thrown back, his knee
almost at the height of his chin. He also sang
that seeming sorrowful melody of the mountain
joy, accented to an extravagant exultation by
his leaping and the flashing of his eyes.</p>

<p>“If he had not been there doubtless the twelve
would have astonished the scarlet men and myself
just as much, for they too were tall, danced
the same leaping dance, sang the mountain
song with the same wild and violent joy, and
were likewise armed only with short daggers.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the leader stopped; the twelve
stopped; the green army stopped; all were
silent. The scarlet men continued to advance,
not without glancing at one another for the
first time, with inquiry in their looks, followed
by scorn; they expected the enemy to turn and
fly. They had no sooner formed this opinion
than the tall green leader leaped forward again
singing, the twelve leaped after him, the sea-like
edge of the green army swayed onward.
Almost a smile of satisfaction spread over the
stiff faces of their opponents, for there was now
but a little distance between the armies; how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
easily they would push through that frivolous
prancing multitude&mdash;if indeed it ever dared to
meet their onset. This was the one fear of the
scarlet men, that the next minute was not to
see the clash and the victory, that they would
have to plunge once more into the forest, the
mist, the silence, after a foe that seemed to them
as inhuman as those things and perhaps related
to them.</p>

<p>“Suddenly again the green leader was rigid,
his song ceased. The twelve, the whole green
army, were as statues. A smile grew along the
line of the scarlet men when they had conquered
their surprise, a smile of furious pity for such
a dancing-master and his dancing-school&mdash;a
smile presently of uneasiness as the seconds
passed and they could hear only the sound of
their own tread. The silence of all those men
unnerved them. Now ... would the green
men turn? Some of the scarlet men, eager to
make sure of grappling with the enemy, quickened
their step, but not all. The green men did not
turn. Once again the dance and the song
leaped up, this time as if at a signal from the low
sun which smote across the green leader’s breast,
like a shield, and like a banner. Wilder than
ever the dance and the song of the green men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
The scarlet men could see their eyes now, and
even the small daggers like jewels in the hands
of the leaders. Some were still full of indignant
hate and already held the dancers firm on the
points of their bayonets. Some thought that
there was a trick, they knew not how it might
end. Some wished to wait kneeling, thus to
receive the dancers on their steadfast points.
Some were afraid, looking to left and right for
a sign. One tripped intentionally and fell.
The line became as jagged as if it were a delicate
thing blown by the wind. The green leader
cut the line in two without stopping his dance,
leaving his dagger in the throat of a rifleman.
Not one of the twelve but penetrated the breaking
line in the course of the dance. The whole green
army surged through the scarlet without ceasing
their song, which seemed to hover above them
like spray over waves. Then they turned.</p>

<p>“The scarlet men did not turn. They ran
swiftly now, and it was their backs that met the
spears of the green men as they crowded into
the forest. The tall, weaponless, leaping singer
seemed everywhere, above and round about,
turning the charge and thrust of the green men
into a lovely and a joyous thing like the arrival
of Spring in March, making the very trees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
ghastly to the scarlet fugitives running hither
and thither silently to their deaths. Not one
of the defeated survived, for the few that eluded
their pursuers could not escape the mist, nor yet
the song of the green leader, except by death,
which they gave to themselves in sadness.</p>

<p>“I cannot wonder that the hero’s dancing and
singing were not to be withstood by his enemies,
since to me it was divine and so moving that I
could not help trying to imitate both song and
dance while I was walking and dreaming.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that ever happened to me,”
said Mr Stodham. “But I thought you meant
a real battle. It was lucky you weren’t run
over if you were dreaming like that along the
road.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I was not born to be run over,”
said Aurelius.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="smaller">NED OF GLAMORGAN</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Long after his celebrated introduction to
Abercorran House, and soon after Philip and I
had been asking old Jack again about the
blackthorn stick, Mr Stodham was reminded
of the story of the Welshman on London
Bridge who was carrying a hazel stick cut on
Craig-y-Dinas. “Do you remember it?”
asked Mr Morgan.</p>

<p>“Certainly I do,” replied Mr Stodham, “and
some day the stick you gave me from that same
Craig-y-Dinas shall carry me thither.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will. It is a fine country for a man
to walk in with a light heart, or, the next best
thing, with a heavy heart. They will treat you
well, because they will take you for a red-haired
Welshman and you like pastry. But what I
wanted to say was that the man who first told
that story of Craig-y-Dinas was one of the
prime walkers of the world. Look at this
portrait of him....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Here Mr Morgan opened a small book of our
grandfather’s time which had for a frontispiece
a full-length portrait of a short, old, spectacled
man in knee breeches and buckled shoes, grasping
a book in one hand, a very long staff in the other.</p>

<p>“Look at him. He was worthy to be immortalised
in stained glass. He walked into London
from Oxford one day and mentioned the fact
to some acquaintances in a bookshop. They
were rather hard of believing, but up spoke a
stranger who had been observing the pedestrian,
his way of walking, the shape of his legs, and the
relative position of his knees and ankles whilst
standing erect. This man declared that the
Welshman could certainly have done the walk
without fatigue; and he ought to have known,
for he was the philosopher, Walking Stewart.</p>

<p>“It was as natural for this man in the picture
to walk as for the sun to shine. You would
like to know England, Mr Stodham, as he knew
Wales, especially Glamorgan. Rightly was he
entitled ‘Iolo Morganwg,’ or Edward of
Glamorgan, or, rather, Ned of Glamorgan.
The name will outlive most stained glass, for
one of the finest collections of Welsh history,
genealogies, fables, tales, poetry, etc., all in old
manuscripts, was made by him, and was named<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
after him in its published form&mdash;‘Iolo Manuscripts.’
He was born in Glamorgan, namely
at Penon, in 1746, and when he was eighty he
died at Flimstone in the same county.</p>

<p>“As you may suppose, he was not a rich man,
and nobody would trouble to call him a gentleman.
But he was an Ancient Briton, and not
the last one: he said once that he always
possessed the freedom of his thoughts and
the independence of his mind ‘with an
Ancient Briton’s warm pride.’</p>

<p>“His father was a stonemason, working here,
there, and everywhere, in England and Wales,
in town and country. When the boy first learnt
his alphabet, it was from the letters cut by
his father on tombstones. His mother&mdash;the
daughter of a gentleman&mdash;undoubtedly a gentleman,
for he had ‘wasted a pretty fortune’&mdash;taught
him to read from the songs in a ‘Vocal
Miscellany.’ She read Milton, Pope, ‘The
Spectator,’ ‘The Whole Duty of Man,’ and
‘Religio Medici,’ and sang as well. But
the boy had to begin working for his father
at the age of nine. Having such a mother, he
did not mix with other children, but returned
nightly to read or talk with her, or, if he did not,
he walked by himself in solitary places. Later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
on, he would always read by himself in the
dinner-hour instead of going with his fellow-workmen
to the inn. Once he was left, during
the dinner-hour, in charge of a parsonage that
was being repaired, and, having his own affairs
to mind, he let all the fowls and pigs in. His
father scolded him, and he went off, as the old
man supposed, to pout for a week or two with
his mother’s people at Aberpergwm, near Pont
Neath Vaughan. It was, however, some months
before he reappeared&mdash;from London, not Aberpergwm.
Thus, in his own opinion, he became
‘very pensive, very melancholy, and very
stupid,’ but had fits of ‘wild extravagance.’
And thus, at the time of his mother’s death,
though he was twenty-three, he was ‘as ignorant
of the world as a new-born child.’ Without his
mother he could not stay in the house, so he
set off on a long wandering. He went hither
and thither over a large part of England and
Wales, ‘studying chiefly architecture and other
sciences that his trade required.’”</p>

<p>“There was a mason,” said Mr Stodham, “such
as Ruskin wanted to set carving evangelists and
kings.”</p>

<p>“No. He knew too much, or half-knew too
much. Besides, he hated kings.... Those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
travels confirmed him in the habit of walking.
He was too busy and enthusiastic ever to have
become an eater, and he found that walking
saved him still more from eating. He could
start early in the morning and walk the forty-three
miles into Bristol without any food on the
way; and then, after walking about the town
on business, and breaking his fast with bread
and butter and tea, and sleeping in a friend’s
chair, could walk back again with no more food;
and, moreover, did so of choice, not from any
beastly principle or necessity. He travelled
thus with ‘more alacrity and comfort,’ than
at other times when he had taken food more
frequently. He always was indifferent to animal
food and wine. Tea was his vice, tempered by
sugar and plenty of milk and cream. Three or
four distinct brews of an evening suited him.
Once a lady assured him that she was handing
him his sixteenth cup. He was not a teetotaller,
though his verses for a society of journeymen
masons ‘that met weekly to spend a cheerful
hour at the moderate and restricted expense
of fourpence,’ are no better than if he had
been a teetotaller from his cradle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Whilst Mirth and good ale our warm spirits recruit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll drunk’ness avoid, that delight of a brute:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of matters of State we’ll have nothing to say,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Give the song and full bumper&mdash;our sweethearts and wives.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At one time he made a fixed resolve not to
<i>sit</i> in the public room of an ale-house, because
he feared the conviviality to which his talent
for song-writing conduced. But it is a fact
that a man who lives out of doors can eat
and drink anything, everything, or almost
nothing, and thrive beyond the understanding
of quacks.</p>

<p>“Iolo walked night and day, and would see a
timid gentleman home at any hour if only he
could have a chair by his fireside to sleep. He
got to prefer sleeping in a chair partly because
his asthma forbade him to lie down, partly
because it was so convenient to be able to read
and write up to the last moment and during any
wakeful hours. With a table, and pen, ink,
paper, and books beside him, he read, wrote,
and slept, at intervals, and at dawn usually let
himself out of the house for a walk. During a
visit to the Bishop of St David’s at Abergwili
he was to be seen in the small hours pacing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
hall of the episcopal palace, in his nightcap, a
book in one hand, a candle in the other. Probably
he read enormously, but too much alone,
and with too little intercourse with other readers.
Besides his native Welsh he taught himself
English, French, Latin and Greek. His memory
was wonderful, but he had no power of arrangement;
when he came to write he could not find
his papers without formidable searches, and
when found could not put them in an available
form. I imagine he did not treat what he read,
like most of us, as if it were removed several
degrees from what we choose to call reality.
Everything that interested him at all he accepted
eagerly unless it was one of the few things he
was able to condemn outright as a lie. I suppose
it was the example of Nebuchadnezzar that
made him try one day ‘in a thinly populated
part of North Wales’ eating nothing but grass,
until the very end, when he gave way to
bread and cheese.</p>

<p>“He had a passion for antiquities.”</p>

<p>“What an extraordinary thing,” ejaculated
Mr Stodham.</p>

<p>“Not very,” said Mr Morgan. “He was
acquisitive and had little curiosity. He was a
collector of every sort and quality of old manu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>script.
Being an imperfectly self-educated man
he probably got an innocent conceit from his
learned occupation....”</p>

<p>“But how could he be an old curiosity man,
and such an out-door man as well?”</p>

<p>“His asthma and pulmonary trouble, whatever
it was, probably drove him out of doors.
Borrow, who was a similar man of a different
class, was driven out in the same way as a lad.
Iolo’s passion for poetry was not destroyed,
but heightened, by his travels. God knows
what poetry meant to him. But when he was
in London, thinking of Wales and the white
cots of Glamorgan, he wrote several stanzas
of English verse. Sometimes he wrote about
nymphs and swains, called Celia, Damon, Colin,
and the like. He wrote a poem to Laudanum:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘O still exert thy soothing power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Fate leads on the welcom’d hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To bear me hence away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To where pursues no ruthless foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No feeling keen awakens woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No faithless friends betray.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I could do no worse than that,” murmured
Mr Stodham confidently.</p>

<p>“He wrote a sonnet to a haycock, and another
to Hope on an intention of emigrating to America:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Th’ American wilds, where Simplicity’s reign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will cherish the Muse and her pupil defend ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll dwell with Content in the desert alone.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They were blessed days when Content still
walked the earth with a capital C, and probably
a female form in light classic drapery. There
was Felicity also. Iolo wrote ‘Felicity, a
pastoral.’ He composed a poem to the cuckoo,
and translated the famous Latin couplet which
says that two pilgrimages to St David’s are
equivalent to one to Rome itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Would haughty Popes your senses bubble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And once to Rome your steps entice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis quite as well, and saves some trouble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go visit old Saint Taffy twice.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He wrote quantities of hymns. Once, to get
some girls out of a scrape&mdash;one having played
‘The Voice of Her I Love’ on the organ after
service&mdash;he wrote a hymn to the tune, ‘The
Voice of the Beloved,’ and fathered it on an
imaginary collection of Moravian hymns. One
other virtue he had, as a bard: he never
repeated his own verses. God rest his soul.
He was a walker, not a writer. The best
of him&mdash;in fact, the real man altogether&mdash;refused
to go into verse at all.</p>

<p>“Yet he had peculiarities which might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
adorned a poet. Once, when he was on a
job in a churchyard at Dartford, his master
told him to go next morning to take certain
measurements. He went, and, having taken the
measurements, <i>woke</i>. It was pitch dark, but
soon afterwards a clock struck two. In spite
of the darkness he had not only done what
he had to do, but he said that on his way to
the churchyard every object appeared to him
as clear as by day. The measurements were
correct.</p>

<p>“One night, asleep in his chair, three women
appeared to him, one with a mantle over her
head. There was a sound like a gun, and one
of the others fell, covered in blood. Next day,
chance took him&mdash;was it chance?&mdash;into a farm
near Cowbridge where he was welcomed by
three women, one hooded in a shawl. Presently
a young man entered with a gun, and laid it
on the table, pointing at one of the women.
At Iolo’s warning it was discovered that the
gun was primed and at full cock.</p>

<p>“Another time, between Cowbridge and Flimstone,
he hesitated thrice at a stile, and then,
going over, was just not too late to save a
drunken man from a farmer galloping down
the path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“In spite of his love of Light and Liberty, he
was not above turning necromancer with wand
and magic circle to convert a sceptic inn-keeper.
He undertook to call up the man’s grandfather,
and after some gesticulations and muttering
unknown words, he whispered, ‘I feel the
approaching spirit. Shall it appear?’ The
man whom he was intending to benefit became
alarmed, and begged to be allowed to hear the
ghost speak, first of all. In a moment a deep,
sepulchral voice pronounced the name of the
grandfather. The man had had enough. He
bolted from the place, leaving Iolo and his
confederates triumphant.</p>

<p>“Iolo should have been content to leave it
unproved that he was no poet. But he had not
an easy life, and I suppose he had to have frills
of some sort.</p>

<p>“Well, he walked home to Glamorgan. There
he took a Glamorgan wife, Margaret Roberts
of Marychurch, and he had to read less and
work more to provide for a family. By the
nature of his handiwork he was able to make
more out of his verses than he would have done
by printing better poetry. The vile doggerel
which he inscribed on tombstones gained him
a living and a sort of an immortality. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
one of the masons employed on the monument
to the Man of Ross.</p>

<p>“Though a bad poet he was a Welsh bard. It
was not the first or the last occasion on which
the two parts were combined. Bard, for him,
was a noble name. He was a ‘Christian Briton
and Bard’&mdash;a ‘Bard according to the rights
and institutes of the Bards of the Island of
Britain’&mdash;and he never forgot the bardic
triad, ‘Man, Liberty, and Light.’ Once, at
the prison levee of a dissenting minister, he
signed himself, ‘Bard of Liberty.’ To Southey,
whom he helped with much out-of-the-way
bardic mythology for his ‘Madoc,’ he was
‘Bard Williams.’</p>

<p>“Bardism brought him into strange company,
which I dare say he did not think strange, and
certainly not absurd. Anna Seward, who mistook
herself for a poet, and was one of the worst
poets ever denominated ‘Swan,’ was kind
to him in London. He in return initiated her
into the bardic order at a meeting of ‘Ancient
British Bards resident in London,’ which was
convened on Primrose Hill at the Autumnal
equinox, 1793. At an earlier meeting, also on
Primrose Hill, he had recited an ‘Ode on the
Mythology of the British Bards in the manner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Taliesin,’ and, since this poem was subsequently
approved at the equinoctial, and ratified at the
solstitial, convention, it was, according to ancient
usage, fit for publication. It was not a reason.
Nevertheless, a bard is a bard, whatever else he
may or may not be.</p>

<p>“Iolo was proud to declare that the old Welsh
bards had kept up a perpetual war with the
church of Rome, and had suffered persecution.
‘Man, Liberty, and Light.’ You and I, Mr
Stodham, perhaps don’t know what he meant.
But if Iolo did not know, he was too happy to
allow the fact to emerge and trouble him.</p>

<p>“Of course, he connected the bards with
Druidism, which he said they had kept alive.
A good many sectarians would have said that
he himself was as much a Druid as a Christian.
He accepted the resurrection of the dead. He
did not reject the Druid belief in transmigration
of souls. He identified Druidism with the
patriarchal religion of the Old Testament, but
saw in it also a pacific and virtually Christian
spirit. He affirmed that Ancient British
Christianity was strongly tinctured by Druidism,
and it was his opinion that the ‘Dark Ages’
were only dark through our lack of light. He
hated the stories of Cæsar and others about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
human sacrifices, and would say to opponents,
‘You are talking of what you don’t understand&mdash;of
what none but a Welshman and a British
bard <i>can possibly</i> understand.’ He compared
the British mythology favourably with the
‘barbarous’ Scandinavian mythology of Thor
and Odin. He studied whatever he could come
at concerning Druidism, with the ‘peculiar bias
and firm persuasion’ that ‘more wisdom and
beneficence than is popularly attributed to them’
would be revealed.</p>

<p>“In the French Revolution he recognised the
spirit of ‘Man, Liberty, and Light.’ His
friends deserted him. He in turn was willing
to leave them for America, ‘to fly from the
numerous injuries he had received from the
laws of this land.’ He had, furthermore, the
hope of discovering the colony settled in America,
as some believed, by the mediæval Welsh
prince Madoc.”</p>

<p>“That was like Borrow, too,” suggested
Mr Stodham.</p>

<p>“It was, and the likeness is even closer; for,
like Borrow, Iolo did not go to America. Nevertheless,
to prepare himself for the adventure, he
lived out of doors for a time, sleeping in trees
and on the ground, and incurring rheumatism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“But though he did not go to America for love
of Liberty, he had his papers seized, and is said
to have been summoned by Pitt for disaffection
to the State. Nothing worse was proved against
him than the authorship of several songs in
favour of Liberty, ‘perhaps,’ said his biographer,
‘a little more extravagant than was quite
commendable at that inflammatory period.’
They expected him to remove his papers himself,
but he refused, and had them formally
restored by an official. When he was fifty he
gave up his trade because the dust of the stone
was injuring his lungs. He now earned a
living by means of a shop at Cowbridge where
books, stationery, and grocery were sold. His
speciality was ‘East India Sweets uncontaminated
by human gore.’ Brothers of his who had
made money in Jamaica offered to allow him
£50 a year, but in vain. ‘It was a land of
slaves,’ he said. He would not even administer
their property when it was left to him, though
a small part was rescued later on by friends,
for his son and daughter. The sound of the
bells at Bristol celebrating the rejection of
Wilberforce’s Anti-Slavery Bill drove him straight
out of the city. Believing that he was spied
upon at Cowbridge he offered a book for sale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
in his window, labelled ‘The Rights of Man.’
He was successful. The spies descended on him,
seized the book, and discovered that it was the
Bible, not the work of Paine.</p>

<p>“He was personally acquainted with Paine
and with a number of other celebrities, such as
Benjamin Franklin, Bishop Percy, Horne Tooke,
and Mrs Barbauld. Once in a bookshop he
asked Dr Johnson to choose for him among
three English grammars. Johnson was turning
over the leaves of a book, ‘rapidly and as the
bard thought petulantly’: ‘Either of them
will do for you, young man,’ said he. ‘Then,
sir,’ said Iolo, thinking Johnson was insulting
his poverty, ‘to make sure of having the best
I will buy all’; and he used always to refer
to them as ‘Dr Johnson’s Grammars.’ It
was once arranged that he should meet Cowper,
but the poet sat, through the evening, silent,
unable to encounter the introduction.</p>

<p>“The excesses of the Revolution, it is said,
drove Iolo to abandon the idea of a Republic,
except as a ‘theoretic model for a free government.’
He even composed an ode to the
Cowbridge Volunteers. Above all, he wrote
an epithalamium on the marriage of George
the Fourth, which he himself presented, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
in a new apron of white leather and carrying
a bright trowel. His ‘English Poems’ were
dedicated to the Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p>“What a fearful fall,” exclaimed Mr Stodham,
who may himself have been a Bard of Liberty.</p>

<p>“But his business, apart from his trade, was
antiquities, and especially the quest of them
up and down Wales.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” said Mr Stodham,
“if the old man hoped for some grand result
from meddling with those mysterious old books
and papers&mdash;perhaps nothing definite, health,
wealth, wisdom, beauty, everlasting life, or
the philosopher’s stone,&mdash;but some old secret
of Bardism or Druidism, which would glorify
Wales, or Cowbridge, or Old Iolo himself.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. He was to a scientific antiquary
what a witch is to an alchemist, and many a
witch got a reputation with less to her credit
than he had.</p>

<p>“As a boy he remembered hearing an old
shoemaker of Llanmaes (near Lantwit) speak of
the shaft of an ancient cross, in Lantwit churchyard,
falling into a grave that had been dug
too near it for Will the Giant of Lantwit. As
a middle-aged man he dug up the stone. It
was less love of antiquity than of mystery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
buried treasure, and the like. He was unweariable
in his search for the remains of Ancient
British literature. At the age of seventy, when
the Bishop of St David’s had mislaid some of
his manuscripts and they had thus been sold,
Iolo walked over Caermarthenshire, Pembrokeshire,
and Cardiganshire, and recovered the
greater part. He took a pony with him as far
as Caermarthen, but would not allow it to carry
his wallets until at last it was arranged that his
son should walk on one side and himself on the
other, which made him remark that ‘nothing
was more fatiguing than a horse.’ The horse
appears in a triad of his own composition:</p>

<p>“There are three things I do not want. A
Horse, for I have a good pair of legs: a Cellar,
for I drink no beer: a Purse, for I have no
money.</p>

<p>“He would not ride in Lord Dunraven’s
carriage, but preferred to walk. That he did
not dislike the animal personally is pretty clear.
For at one time he kept a horse which followed
him, of its own free will, upon his walks.</p>

<p>“Iolo was a sight worth seeing on the highways
and byways of Glamorgan, and once had
the honour of being taken for a conjuror. His
biographer&mdash;a man named Elijah Waring, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
was proud to have once carried his wallets&mdash;describes
him ‘wearing his long grey hair
flowing over his high coat collar, which, by
constant antagonism, had pushed up his hat-brim
into a quaint angle of elevation behind.
His countenance was marked by a combination
of quiet intelligence and quick sensitiveness;
the features regular, the lines deep, and the
grey eye benevolent but highly excitable. He
was clad, when he went to see a bishop, in a
new coat fit for an admiral, with gilt buttons
and buff waistcoat, but, as a rule, in rustic
garb: the coat blue, with goodly brass buttons,
and the nether integuments, good homely
corduroy. He wore buckles in his shoes, and
a pair of remarkably stout well-set legs were
vouchers for the great peripatetic powers he
was well known to possess. A pair of canvas
wallets were slung over his shoulders, one depending
in front, the other behind. These
contained a change of linen, and a few books
and papers connected with his favourite pursuits.
He generally read as he walked....’”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” remarked Mr Stodham, “that
spoils all.”</p>

<p>“He generally read as he walked, ‘with
spectacles on nose,’ and a pencil in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
serving him to make notes as they suggested
themselves. Yet he found time also, Mr
Stodham, to sow the tea-plant on the hills of
Glamorgan. ‘A tall staff which he grasped at
about the level of his ear completed his equipment;
and he was accustomed to assign as a
reason for this mode of using it, that it tended
to expand the pectoral muscles, and thus, in
some degree, relieve a pulmonary malady inherent
in his constitution.’</p>

<p>“He did not become a rich man. Late one
evening he entered a Cardiganshire public-house
and found the landlord refusing to let a
pedlar pay for his lodging in kind, though he was
penniless. Iolo paid the necessary shilling for a
bed and rated the landlord, but had to walk on
to a distant friend because it was his last shilling.
Yet he wrote for the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
and corresponded with the <i>Monthly</i> and
others, so that towards the end he was entitled
to advances from the Literary Fund. An
annual subscription was also raised for him in
Neath and the neighbourhood. His last three
years he spent at Flimstone, where he is buried.
He was a cripple and confined to the house,
until one day he rested his head on the side of
his easy chair and told his daughter that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
was free from pain and could sleep, and so he
died.”</p>

<p>“I will certainly go to Craig-y-Dinas,” said
Mr Stodham solemnly, “and to Penon, and to
Cowbridge, and to Flimstone.”</p>

<p>“You will do well,” said Mr Morgan, shutting
up Elijah Waring’s little book and getting out
the map of Glamorgan.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CASTLE OF LEAVES AND THE BEGGAR
WITH THE LONG WHITE BEARD</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Ann was good to all beggars as well as to old
Jack, the watercress man, and when I asked
her about it once she told the story of the Castle
of Leaves. This castle was a ruin above the
sea near where she was born. So fragmentary
and fallen was it that every November the oak
leaves covered it up. As a little child, Ann
was taken up there on a May day because the
hawthorn growing there always blossomed in
time, however backward the season. Sitting
among the ruins was an old white-haired man
playing on a harp, and for ever after she loved
beggars, said Aurelius, as if they were all going
to have harps and long white beards in due
course. A white-haired beggar, according to
tradition, was infallibly to be found by anyone
who went up to the Castle of Leaves on May
day, and the story which connects a beggar
with the early days of the castle might of itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
explain why Ann never denied a beggar. Both
Mr Morgan and Ann knew the story, but Mr
Morgan had found it written in a book, with
the date 1399, while Ann told it without a date
as she remembered it from the dark ages of
her own childhood.</p>

<p>In those old days, if Ann was to be believed,
there was nothing but war. The young men
went out to battle and never came back except
as spirits, or as old men, or as worse than either&mdash;some
of them having no more legs or arms than
a fish, some crawling on their bellies with their
beards in the mud, or flapping along in the wind
like a kind of bird, or as lean and scattered
as crickets&mdash;so that the children laughed at
them first and then ran away crying to their
mothers because they had such fathers. The
mothers did not laugh save those that went mad,
and perhaps they were not the worst off. The
women knew that these strange idols and
images crawling and jiggering home were the
same that had marched out to the war as if their
sweethearts were in the far countries before
them, instead of behind them at the turnings
of the roads. They would not have loved them
so much if they had not gone out like that.
The glorious young men departed; the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
women were no longer beautiful without them;
the little children were blossoms of the grave.
The world was full of old men, maimed men,
and young men going to the wars, and of women
crying because the soldiers had not come back,
and children crying because they had. And
many and many a one had no more tears left
to cry with.</p>

<p>Beggars appeared and disappeared who looked
like men, but spoke all manner of tongues and
knew not where their fathers or mothers or
children were, if they had any left, or if ever
they had any, which was doubtful, for they
were not as other men, but as if they had come
thus into the astonished world, resembling
carrion walking, or rotten trees by the roadside.
Few could till the fields, and it was always a
good summer for thistles, never for corn. The
cattle died and there was nothing to eat the
grass. Some said it was a judgment. But
what had the poor cows and sheep done? What
had the young men and women done? They
were but mankind. Nor were the great ones
the worse for it. They used to come back from
the wars with gold and unicorns and black
slaves carrying elephants’ tusks and monkeys.
Whether or not it was a judgment, it was misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>But one day there was a white ship in the
harbour of Abercorran. A man named Ivor
ap Cadogan had come back who had been away
in Arabia, Cathay, and India, in Ophir and all
the East, since he was a boy. No man knew
his family. He was a tall man with yellow
hair and a long beard of gold, and he was always
singing to himself, and he was like a king who
has thrown away his crown, nor had he soldiers
with him, but only the dark foreign men who
followed him from the ships. All day long,
day after day, they were unlading and carrying
up beautiful white stone from the ship to build
a great shining castle above the sea. In a little
while came another ship out of the east, and
another, and another, like swans, coming in
silent to the harbour. All were heavy laden
with the white stone, and with precious woods,
which men carried up into the hills above the
shore. The sea forgot everything but calm
all through that summer while they were unlading
the ships and building.</p>

<p>The finished castle was as huge and white,
but not as terrible, as a mountain peak when
the snow has been chiselled by the north wind
for many midnights, and the wood of it smelt
round about as sweet as a flower, summer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
winter. And Ivor ap Cadogan dwelt in the
castle, which was at that time called the Castle
of Ophir. It had no gates, no moat or portcullis,
for no one was refused or sent away.
Its fires never went out. Day and night in
winter the sky over the castle was bright with
the many fires and many lights. Round the
walls grew trees bearing golden fruit, and among
them fountains of rustling crystal stood up
glittering for ever like another sort of trees.</p>

<p>People dreamed about the shining, white
castle, and its gold, its music, its everlasting
festivals of youths and maidens.</p>

<p>Upon the roads now there were no more incomplete
or withered men, or if they were they
were making for the Castle of Ophir among the
hills. It was better, said all men, to be a
foreigner, or a monkey, or any one of the
wondrous beasts that wandered in the castle, or
any of the birds that flew round the towers, or
any of the fish in the ponds under the fountains,
than to be a man upon the roads or in the
villages. No man now walked up and down
until he had to sit, or sat until he had to lie, or
lay until he could rise no more and so died.
They went up to the Castle of Ophir and were
healed, and dwelt there happily for ever after.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Those that came back said that in the castle
they were just as happy whether they were
working hard or doing nothing: stiff, labouring
men whose chief pleasure used to be in
resting from toil, could be idle and happy in
the castle long after their toil had been forgotten.
The charcoal-burners slept until they
were clean, and the millers until they were
swarthy, and it seemed to them that the lives
of their fathers had been a huddle of wretchedness
between birth and death. Even the young
men ceased going to the wars, but went instead
to the castle and the music and the feasting.
All men praised Ivor ap Cadogan. Once a lord
from beyond the mountains sent men against
the castle to carry off gold, but they remained
with Ivor and threw their weapons into the
ponds.</p>

<p>From time to time the white ships put out
again from Abercorran, and again returned.
When their sails appeared in the bay, it was
known that calm had settled upon the sea as in
the first year, and men and women went down
to welcome them. Those summers were good
both for man and beast. The earth brought
forth tall, heavy corn which no winds beat
down. Granaries were full: at the castle a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
granary, as large as a cathedral, was so full that
the rats and mice had no room and so threw
themselves into the sea. And Ivor ap Cadogan
grew old. His beard was as white as the sails
of his ships. A great beard it was, not like those
of our day, and you could see it blowing over
his shoulder a mile away as he walked the hills.
So some men began to wonder whether one
day he would die, and who would be master
then, and whether it would still be calm when
the ships sailed. But Summer came, and with
it the ships, and Autumn and the cramming
of granaries and the songs of harvest, and
men forgot.</p>

<p>The next Summer was more glorious than
any before. Only, the ships never came. The
sea was quiet as the earth, as blue as the sky.
The white clouds rose up out of the sea, but
never one sail. Ivor went to the high places
to watch, and lifted a child upon his shoulders
to watch for him. No ship came. Ivor went
no more to the cliffs, but stayed always on
the topmost towers of the castle, walking to
and fro, watching, while down below men
were bringing in the harvest and the songs
had begun.</p>

<p>When at last the west wind blew, and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
ship arrived, it was not in the harbour but on
the rocks, and it was full of dead men. Ivor
and all the people of the castle went down to
see the ship and the dead men. When they
returned at nightfall the wind had blown the
leaves from the castle trees into the rooms so
that they were almost filled. The strange birds
of the castle were thronging the air, in readiness
to fly over the sea. The strange animals of the
castle had left their comfort and were roaming
in the villages, where they were afterwards
killed. The old men prophesied terrible things.
The women were afraid. The children stood,
pale and silent, watching the dead leaves swim
by like fishes, crimson and emerald and gold,
and they pretended that they were mermen
and mermaids sitting in a palace under the
sea. But the women took the children away
along the road where the old men had already
gone. Led by Ivor, the young men descended
to the shore to repair the ship.</p>

<p>It was a winter of storm: men could not hear
themselves speak for the roaring of sea, wind,
and rain, and the invisible armies of the air.
With every tide bodies of men and of the strange
birds that had set out over the sea were washed
up. Men were not glad to see Ivor and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
dark companions at last departing in the mended
ship. The granaries were full, and no one
starved, but time passed and no more ships
arrived. No man could work. The castle
stood empty of anything but leaves, and in
their old cottages men did not love life. The
Spring was an ill one; nothing was at work
in the world save wind and rain; now the uproar
of the wind drowned that of the rain, now
the rain drowned the wind, and often the crying
of women and children drowned both. Men
marked the differences, and hoped for an end
which they were powerless to pursue. When
the one ship returned, its cargo was of birds
and beasts such as had escaped in the falling of
the leaves. Ivor alone was glad of them. He
had few followers&mdash;young men all of them&mdash;up
to the castle. Others came later, but went
down again with loads of corn. It was now
seen that the granaries would some day be
emptied. People began to talk without respect
of Ivor. They questioned whence his wealth
had come, by what right he had built the castle,
why he had concealed his birth. The young
men living with him quarrelled among themselves,
then agreed in reproaching the master.
At last they left the castle in twos and threes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
accusing him of magic, of causing them to forget
their gratitude to God. In the villages everyone
was quarrelling except when the talk turned
to blaming Ivor. He made no reply, nor ever
came down amongst them, but stayed in the
inmost apartment with his remaining birds.
One of the complaints against him was that he
fed the birds on good grain. Yet the people
continued to go up to the granaries at need.
The beggars and robbers of the mountains were
beginning to contest their right to it, and blood
was shed in many of the rooms and corridors.
No one saw the master. They said that they
did not care, or they said that he was dead and
buried up in leaves; but in truth they were
afraid of his white hair, his quiet eye, and the
strange birds and beasts. Between them, the
robbers and the young men who had served
him plundered the house. Some even attempted
to carry off the masonry, but left most of it
along the roadside where it lies to this day.
At length, nothing worth a strong man’s time
had been overlooked. A few beggars were
the latest visitors, cursing the empty granary,
trembling at the footsteps of leaves treading
upon leaves in all the rooms. They did not see
Ivor, sitting among leaves and spiders’ webs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
A pack of hounds, hunting that way, chased the
stag throughout the castle but lost it; for it
entered the room where Ivor was sitting, and
when the horn was blown under the new moon
the hounds slunk out bloodless yet assuaged,
and the hunter thrashed them for their lack of
spirit, and cursed the old man for his magic,
yet ventured not in search of him along those
muffled corridors. The very road up to the
castle was disappearing. The master, it was
believed, had died. The old men who had
known him were dead; the young men were at
the wars. When a white-haired beggar stumbled
into Abercorran from the hills few admitted,
though all knew in their hearts, that it was
Ivor ap Cadogan. For a year or two he was
fed from door to door, but he wearied his benefactors
by talking continually about his birds
that he had lost. Some of the rich remembered
against him his modesty, others his ostentation.
The poor accused him of pride; such was the
name they gave to his independent tranquillity.
Perhaps, some thought, it was a judgment&mdash;the
inhabitants of the Castle of Ophir had been
too idle and too happy to think of the shortness
of this life and the glory to come. So he
disappeared. Probably he went to some part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
where he was not known from any other wandering
beggar. “Wonderful long white beards,”
said Ann, “men had in those days&mdash;longer
than that old harper’s, and to-day there are
none even like him. Men to-day can do a
number of things which the old ages never
dreamed of, but their beards are nothing in
comparison to those unhappy old days when
men with those long white beards used to sit
by the roadsides, looking as if they had come
from the ends of the earth, like wise men from
the East, although they were so old that they
sat still with their beards reaching to the ground
like roots. Ivor ap Cadogan was one of these.”</p>

<p>Mr Morgan once, overhearing Ann telling me
this tale, said, “What the book says is much
better. It says that in 1399 a Welshman,
named Llewelyn ab Cadwgan, who would never
speak of his family, came from the Turkish war
to reside at Cardiff; and so great was his wealth
that he gave to everyone that asked or could
be seen to be in need of it. He built a large
mansion near the old white tower, for the
support of the sick and infirm. He continued
to give all that was asked of him until his wealth
was all gone. He then sold his house, which
was called the New Place, and gave away the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
money until that also was at an end. After
this he died of want, for no one gave to him,
and many accused him of extravagant waste.”
With that Mr Morgan went gladly and, for him,
rapidly to his books. Nobody seeing him then
was likely to disturb him for that evening. At
his door he turned and said “Good night” to
us in a perfectly kind voice which nevertheless
conveyed, in an unquestionable manner, that he
was not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr Morgan,” said all of us.
“Good night, Ann,” said I, and slipped out into
a night full of stars and of quietly falling leaves,
which almost immediately silenced my attempt
to sing “O the cuckoo is a pretty bird” on the
way home.</p>

<span class="smaller">MR STODHAM SPEAKS FOR ENGLAND&mdash;FOG
SUPERVENES</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Some time after the story of the Castle of
Leaves, Mr Morgan took occasion to point out the
difference between Ann speaking of the “beautiful
long white beards” that men grew in those
“unhappy old days,” and Mr Torrance praising
the “merry” or “good old” England of his
imagination. He said that from what he could
gather they were merry in the old days with little
cause, while to-day, whatever cause there might
be, few persons possessed the ability. He concluded,
I think, that after all there was probably
nothing to be merry about at any time if you
looked round carefully: that, in fact, what was
really important was to be capable of more
merriment and less ado about nothing. Someone
with a precocious sneer, asked if England was
now anything more than a geographical expression,
and Mr Stodham preached a sermon
straight away:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“A great poet said once upon a time that this
earth is ‘where we have our happiness or not
at all.’ For most of those who speak his language
he might have said that this England is where
we have our happiness or not at all. He meant
to say that we are limited creatures, not angels,
and that our immediate surroundings are enough
to exercise all our faculties of mind and body:
there is no need to flatter ourselves with the
belief that we could do better in a bigger or
another world. Only the bad workman complains
of his tools.</p>

<p>“There was another poet who hailed England,
his native land, and asked how could it but be
dear and holy to him, because he declared himself
one who (here Mr Stodham grew very red
and his voice rose, and Lewis thought he was
going to sing as he recited):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘From thy lakes and mountain-hills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy clouds, thy quiet dales, thy rocks and seas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have drunk in all my intellectual life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All sweet sensations, all ennobling thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All adoration of the God in nature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All lovely and all honourable things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever makes this mortal spirit feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The joy and greatness of its future being?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There lives nor form nor feeling in my soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unborrowed from my country. O divine</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And beauteous island! thou hast been my sole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And most magnificent temple, in the which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I walk with awe, and sing my stately songs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loving the God that made me!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Of course, I do not know what it <i>all</i> means,”
he muttered, but went on: “and that other
poet who was his friend called the lark:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Type of the wise who soar but never roam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">True to the kindred points of heaven and home.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, England is home and heaven too. England
made you, and of you is England made. Deny
England&mdash;wise men have done so&mdash;and you may
find yourself some day denying your father and
mother&mdash;and this also wise men have done.
Having denied England and your father and
mother, you may have to deny your own self,
and treat it as nothing, a mere conventional
boundary, an artifice, by which you are separated
from the universe and its creator. To unite
yourself with the universe and the creator, you
may be tempted to destroy that boundary of
your own body and brain, and die. He is a bold
man who hopes to do without earth, England,
family, and self. Many a man dies, having
made little of these things, and if he says at
the end of a long life that he has had enough,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
he means only that he has no capacity for
more&mdash;<i>he</i> is exhausted, not the earth, not
England.</p>

<p>“I do not think that a man who knows many
languages, many histories, many lands, would
ask if England was more than a geographical
expression. Nor would he be the first to attempt
an answer to one that did ask.</p>

<p>“I do not want you to praise England. She
can do without receiving better than you can
without giving. I do not want to shout that
our great soldiers and poets are greater than
those of other nations, but they are ours, they
are great, and in proportion as we are good and
intelligent, we can respond to them and understand
them as those who are not Englishmen
cannot. They cannot long do without us or we
without them. Think of it. We have each of us
some of the blood and spirit of Sir Thomas More,
and Sir Philip Sidney, and the man who wrote
‘Tom Jones,’ and Horatio Nelson, and the man
who wrote ‘Love in the Valley.’ Think what we
owe to them of joy, courage, and mere security.
Try to think what they owe to us, since they
depend on us for keeping alive their spirits, and
a spirit that can value them. They are England:
we are England. Deny England, and we deny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
them and ourselves. Do you love the Wilderness?
Do you love Wales? If you do, you
love what I understand by ‘England.’ The
more you love and know England, the more
deeply you can love the Wilderness and Wales.
I am sure of it....”</p>

<p>At this point Mr Stodham ran away. Nobody
thought how like a <i>very good</i> rat he was during
this speech, or, rather, this series of short speeches
interrupted by moments of excitement when
all that he could do was to light a pipe and let it
out. Higgs, perhaps, came nearest to laughing;
for he struck up “Rule Britannia” with evident
pride that he was the first to think of it. This
raised my gorge; I could not help shouting
“Home Rule for Ireland.” Whereupon Higgs
swore abominably, and I do not know what
would have happened if Ann had not said:
“Jessie, my love, sing <i>Land of my Fathers</i>,”
which is the Welsh national anthem; but when
Jessie sang it&mdash;in English, for our sakes&mdash;everyone
but Higgs joined in the chorus and felt that
it breathed the spirit of patriotism which Mr
Stodham had been trying to express. It was
exulting without self-glorification or any other
form of brutality. It might well be the national
anthem of any nation that knows, and would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
not rashly destroy, the bonds distinguishing
it from the rest of the world without isolating
it.</p>

<p>Aurelius, who had been brooding for some
time, said:</p>

<p>“I should never have thought it. Mr Stodham
has made me a present of a country. I really
did not know before that England was not a
shocking fiction of the journalists and politicians.
I am the richer, and, according to Mr Stodham,
so is England. But what about London fog?
what is the correct attitude of a patriot towards
London fog and the manufacturers who make
it what it is?”</p>

<p>Aurelius got up to look out at the fog, the
many dim trees, the single gas lamp in the lane
beyond the yard. Pointing to the trees, he
<span class="lock">asked&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“‘What are these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So withered and so wild in their attire,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And yet are on’t?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even so must Mr Stodham’s patriotism, or that
of <i>Land of our Fathers</i>, appear to Higgs. His
patriotism is more like the ‘Elephant and
Castle’ on a Saturday night than those trees.
Both are good, as they say at Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>”
And he went out, muttering towards the trees
in the fog:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Live you? or are you aught</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you are so.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For some time we were all silent, until Ann
said: “Hark.” “What is it? another Ripper
murder?” said Higgs. “Oh, shut up, Higgs,”
said Philip looking at Ann. “Hark,” said Ann
again. It was horrible. Somewhere far off I
could hear an angry murmur broken by frantic
metallic clashings. No one sound out of the
devilish babble could I disentangle, still less,
explain. A myriad noises were violently mixed
in one muddy, struggling mass of rumbling
and jangling. The worst gramophones are infinitely
nearer to the cooing of doves than this,
but it had in it something strained, reckless,
drunken-mad, horror-stricken, like the voice of
the gramophone. Above all, the babble was
angry and it was inhuman. I had never heard
it before, and my first thought was that it was
an armed and furious multitude, perhaps a
foreign invader, a mile or so distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t you know it was Saturday night?”
said Higgs. “It is always worse on Saturdays.”</p>

<p>“What is?” said I.</p>

<p>“That noise,” said Higgs.</p>

<p>“Hark,” said Philip anxiously, and we all
held our breath to catch it again. There....
It was no nearer. It was not advancing. It
was always the same. As I realised that it was
the mutter of London, I sighed, being a child,
with relief, but could not help listening still for
every moment of that roar as of interlaced
immortal dragons fighting eternally in a pit.
It was surprising that such a tone could endure.
The sea sounds everlastingly, but this was more
appropriate to a dying curse, and should have
lasted no more than a few minutes. As I
listened it seemed rather to be a brutish yell of
agony during the infliction of some unspeakable
pain, and though pain of that degree would kill
or stupefy in a few minutes, this did not.</p>

<p>“If you like the ‘Elephant and Castle,’” said
Mr Morgan, “you like that. But if you live in
London all your lives, perhaps you may never
hear it again.</p>

<p>“For the sound does not cease. We help to
make it as we do to make England. Even
those weird sisters of Aurelius out in the Wilder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>ness
help to make it by rattling branches and
dropping leaves in the fog. You will hear the
leaves falling, the clock ticking, the fog-signals
exploding, but not London.”</p>

<p>I was, in fact, twenty-one before I heard the
roar again. Never since have I noticed it. But
Ann, it seems, used to hear it continually,
perhaps because she went out so seldom and could
not become one of the mob of unquestionable
“inhabitants o’ the earth.” But when the
window had been shut, we, at any rate, forgot
all about London in that warm room in Abercorran
House, amidst the gleam of china and
the glitter of brass and silver. Lewis and
Harry sat on the floor, in a corner, playing with
lead soldiers. The English army&mdash;that is to
say, Lewis&mdash;was beaten, and refused to accept
its fate. On being told, “But it is all over now,”
he burst out crying. Harry looked on in sympathetic
awe. But before his tears had quite
come to their natural end, a brilliant idea caused
him to uncover his face suddenly and say: “I
know what I shall do. I shall build a tower
like David&mdash;a real one&mdash;in the Wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let’s,” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“Us,” said Lewis, “I like that. It is I that
shall build a tower. But I will <i>employ</i> you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“That,” mused Harry slowly, “means that I
build a tower and let you live in it. That isn’t
right. Mr Gladstone would never allow it.”</p>

<p>“What has Mr Gladstone got to do with the
Wilderness, I should like to know? We <i>employ</i>
him. I should like to see him getting over the
fence into the Wilderness. He does not know
where it is. Besides, if he did, he could <i>never</i>,
<i>never</i>, get into my tower. If he did I would
immediately fling myself down from the top.
Then I should be safe,” shrieked Lewis, before
entering another of those vales or abysses of
tears which were so black for him, and so brief.
It was not so agreeable as silence would have
been, or as Ann’s sewing was, or the continuous
bagpipe music of a kettle always just on the
boil. But Philip had gone upstairs, and the
book on my knee held me more than Lewis’s
tears. This book placed me in a mountain
solitude such as that where David Morgan had
built his tower, and, like that, haunted by
curlews:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The rugged mountain’s scanty cloak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With shingles bare, and cliffs between,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And patches bright of bracken green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And heather black that waved so high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It held the copse in rivalry.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Out of the ambush of copse and heather and
bracken had started up at a chieftain’s whistle&mdash;“wild
as the scream of the curlew”&mdash;a host of
mountaineers, while the Chieftain revealed himself
to the enemy who had imagined him alone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And, Saxon, I am Roderick Dhu.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What is the matter, Arthur?” asked Harry
when I came to this line. I answered him with
a look of trembling contempt. The whole scene
so fascinated me&mdash;I so thrilled with admiration
at everything done by the Highland chieftain&mdash;that
his magic whistle at last pierced me to the
marrow with exquisite joy. In my excitement
I said the words, “And, Saxon, I am Roderick
Dhu,” aloud, yet not loud enough to make
anything but a husky muttering audible. I was
choking and blushing with pleasant pains and
with a desire to pass them on to another, myself
not lacking glory as the discoverer. Hence my
muttering those words aloud: hence the contempt
of my answer to Harry, upon not being
instantly and enthusiastically understood. The
contempt, however, was not satisfying.... I,
too, wished that I possessed a tower upon a
mountain where I could live for ever in a state
of poetic pain. Therefore I went out silently,
saying no good night, not seeing Philip again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>Fog and cold cured me rapidly. On that
wretched night I could no more go on thinking
of a tower on a mountain than I could jump
into a pond. I had to run to get warm. Then
I thought of the book once more: I recovered
my pleasure and my pride. The fog, pierced by
some feeble sparkles of lamps, and dim glows
of windows from invisible houses, the silence,
broken by the dead leaf that rustled after me,
made the world a shadowy vast stage on which
I was the one real thing. The solitary grandeur
was better than any tower, and at the end of
my run, on entering again among people and
bright lights, I could flit out of it as easily as
possible, which was more than Morgan could do,
since to escape from his tower he had to die.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE HOUSE OF THE DAYS OF THE YEAR</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Lewis never did raise a tower in the Wilderness.
His towers were in the air. A wish, with him,
was seldom father to any deed. I think he
expected the wish of itself to create; or if not,
he was at least always angered when the nature
of things proved to be against him. He would
not have been unduly astonished, and would
have been wildly grateful, if he had seen looming
through the fog next morning a tower such
as he desired. But except on paper he never
did. As he drew it, the tower was tall and
slender as the tallest and slenderest factory
chimney, more like a pillar for St Simeon Stylites
than a castle in Spain. It would have been
several times the height of the elms in the
Wilderness which he had furiously refused to
take into his service. It was to be climbed
within by a spiral staircase, each step apparently
having its own little window. Thus it
was riddled by windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>Now, if this idea had come to Philip he would
have executed it. As it was, Lewis’s drawing
delighted him. He liked all those windows
that made it look as if it were a dead stem
rotting away. “But,” said he, “I know a
house better than that, with a window for
every day of the year. It would be just the
thing for you, Lewis, because it is built without
hands, without bricks, stones, cement, or
any expense whatever.... It was only a
dream,” he continued, one day as he and I were
going down the long street which took us almost
straight out into Our Country. But he did not
really think it no more than a dream. He had
seen it many times, a large, shadowy house,
with windows which he had never counted, but
knew to be as many as the days of the year, no
more, no less. The house itself was always
dark, with lights in some of the windows, never,
perhaps, in all.</p>

<p>The strange thing was that Philip believed
this house must actually exist. Perhaps, I
suggested, it was hidden among the trees of
our woods, like several other houses. No: he
dismissed this as fancy. His house was not a
fancy. It lay somewhere in a great city, or at
the verge of one. On his first visit he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
approached it by long wanderings through
innumerable, unknown and deserted streets,
following a trail of white pebbles like the children
in the fairy tale. In all those streets he passed
nobody and heard no sound; nor did this
surprise him, in spite of the fact that he felt
the houses to be thronged with people. Suddenly
out of the last narrow street he came as
it were on a wall of darkness, like night itself.
Into this he was stepping forward when he saw
just beneath and before him a broad, black
river, crossed by a low bridge leading over to
where, high up, a light beamed in the window of
an invisible building. When he began to cross
the bridge he could see that it was the greatest
house he had ever beheld. It was a house
that might be supposed to contain “many
mansions.” “You could not make a house
like that one out of this whole street,” said
Philip. “It stretched across the world, but it
was a house.” On the other side of the river
it seemed still equally far off. Birds flying to
and fro before it never rose up over it, nor did
any come from the other side. Philip hastened
forward to reach the house. But the one light
went out and he awoke.</p>

<p>Philip used to look out for this house when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
was crossing the bridges in London. He scanned
carefully the warehouses and factories rising out of
the water, in long rows with uncounted windows,
that made him wonder what went on behind
them. With this material, he said, a magician
could make a house like the one he was in search
of. Once, when he got home in the evening
from London, he was confident that his house
lay between Waterloo Bridge and Hungerford
Bridge, but next time he was there he was dead
against any such suggestion. A factory on the
edge of a tract of suburb waste fulfilled his
conditions for an hour at another time. He
had been thrilled, too, by a photograph shown
to him by Mr Stodham&mdash;of an ancient palace
standing at the foot of a desolate mountain in
the remote South.</p>

<p>When we were walking together towards the
country Philip used to look, as a matter of
course, down every side street to right or left,
as he always looked up dark alleys in London.
Nor was he content to look once down any one
street, lest he should miss some transformation
or transfiguration. As we began to get clear of
London, and houses were fewer and all had long
front gardens, and shops ceased, Philip looked
ahead now and then as well as from side to side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Beyond the wide, level fields and the tall Lombardy
poplars bounding them, there was nothing,
but there was room for the house. Fog thickened
early in the afternoon over our vacant territories,
but we saw only the trees and a Gypsy
tent under a hedge.</p>

<p>Next day Philip came home feverish from
school, and was put to bed in the middle of the
pale sunny afternoon. He lay happily stretched
out with his eyes fixed on a glass of water near
the window. It flickered in the light.... He
saw the black river gleaming as when a candle
for the first time illuminates a lake in the bowels
of a mountain. There was the house beyond
the river. Six or seven of its windows were lit
up, one large one low down, the rest small, high
up, and, except two of them, wide apart. Now
and then, at other windows here and there, lights
appeared momentarily, like stars uncovered by
rapid clouds.... A lofty central door slowly
swung open. A tiny figure, as solitary as the
first star in the sky, paused at the threshold, to
be swallowed up a moment later in darkness.
At the same moment Philip awoke with a cry,
knowing that the figure was himself.</p>

<p>After this Philip was not so confident of
discovering the house. Yet he was more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
ever certain that it existed, that all the time of
the intervals between his visits it was somewhere.
I told him the story about Irem Dhat El’Imad,
the Terrestrial Paradise of Sheddad the son of
Ad, King of the World, which Aurelius had read
to me. Philip was pleased with the part where
the geometricians and sages, labourers and
artificers of the King search over all the earth,
until they come to rivers and an illimitable
plain, and choose it for the site of the palace
which was three hundred years building. But
he said that this story was not true. His own
great house never disappeared, he said; it was
he that disappeared. By this time he had
become so familiar with the house that he
probably passed hardly a day without a sight
of it, sleeping or waking. He was familiar
with its monotonous front, the many storeys
of not quite regular diminishing windows. It
always seemed to lie out beyond a tract of
solitude, silence, and blackness; it was beyond
the black river; it was at the edge of the earth.
In none of his visits could he get round to the
other side. Several times again, as on that
feverish afternoon, he saw himself entering
through the lofty doorway, never emerging.
What <i>this</i> self (for so he called it, touching his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
breast) saw inside the door he never knew.
That self which looked on could never reach the
door, could not cross the space between it and
the river, though it seemed of no formidable
immensity. Many times he set out to cross and
go in at the other door after the other self, but
could not. Finally he used to imagine that if
once he penetrated to the other side he would see
another world.</p>

<p>Once or twice Philip and I found ourselves
in streets which he thought were connected with
his first journey, but he vainly tried to remember
how. He even used to say that at a certain
number&mdash;once it was 197&mdash;lived some one who
could help. When another dream took him
along the original route of streets he told me that
they were now thronged with people going with
or against him. They were still all about him
as he emerged from the streets in sight of the
house, where every window was blazing with
lights as he had never seen it before. The crowd
was making towards the light across the hitherto
always desolate bridge. Nevertheless, beyond
the river, in the space before the house, he was
alone as before. He resolved to cross the space.
The great door ahead was empty; no other self
at least had the privilege denied to him. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
stood still, looking not at the door, but at the
windows and at the multitudes passing behind
them. His eyes were fixed on the upper windows
and on each face in turn that appeared. Some
faces he recognised without being able to give a
name to one. They must have been people whom
he had encountered in the street, and forgotten
and never seen again until now. Apparently
not one of them saw him standing out there, in
the darkness, looking up at them. He was
separated from them as from the dead, or as a
dead man might be from the living. The moment
he lowered his head to look towards the door,
the dream was over.</p>

<p>More than once afterwards, when Lewis had
ceased to think of his tower, Philip saw the
hundreds of windows burning in the night above
the black river, and saw the stream of faces at
the windows; but he gave up expecting to see
the house by the light of our sun or moon. He
had even a feeling that he would rather not
discover it, that if he were to enter it and join
those faces at the windows he might not return,
never stand out in the dark again and look up
at the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">PHILIP AND THE OUTLAWS OF THE ISLAND</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">That winter when Philip was ill, for the first
time, I used to spend every evening at Abercorran
House, chiefly upstairs, reading aloud or talking.
I was supposed to entertain him, but he did
most of the entertaining. Out of his own head
or out of books he told me hundreds of tales;
in either case they were very much his own. I
cannot imitate him. For example, he would
always bring his characters before himself and
his listener by comparing them to persons known
to both. When he was well and out of doors
he would pick out a man or woman passing
us, or at a window, for a comparison. “This
Palomides,” he would say, “was like that
butcher, but dressed differently: you could see
what good legs he had.” Another was “like
my brother Roland, and if he had been alive
now he could have jumped over spiked railings
up to his own shoulder, though he was not a
little man.” The Icelandic Thorbeorg was “like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
our Jessie: only she would use a knife, and she
had fair hair.” A certain villain was “a
scoundrel, <i>but</i> he had a face like Higgs.” The
man who resembled Roland was an Icelander,
Haurd by name, whom Philip called Roland
throughout the tale. Thorbeorg was his sister.
This was the tale:</p>

<p>Haurd was a head taller than most men, and
he had grand hair. He was clever, strong, and
bold. He swam better than all others, and his
eyesight was wonderful. But he was a touchy
man. Not being asked in the proper manner
to his sister Thurid’s wedding feast, he refused
to go when the bridegroom, Illuge, came on
purpose to fetch him. Yet a little after, when
Geir, his own foster-brother, asked him to go
just to please him, he went. However, at the
feast he treated Illuge lightly; refused the
present of a shield&mdash;accepted a ring, but with
the remark that in his opinion being a brother-in-law
would not mean much to Illuge. Hearing
Haurd say such things in a lazy way for no
apparent reason and taken aback by it, he did
not answer. As soon as he got home, Haurd
gave the ring to his sister, Thorbeorg, bidding
her remember him when he was dead. Soon
afterwards, with Geir and his other foster-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>brother,
Helge, who was a tramp’s son, he left
home.</p>

<p>Twenty years before that, when Thorbeorg’s
mother Signy was married to Grimkel, her
brother Torfe took offence in the same way,
because he was not consulted. Signy was very
fond of him, and it was at his house that she
gave birth to Thorbeorg and died the same day.
Grief for his sister made him hate the child; he
cast it out of the house, and chance alone saved
its life. Thus Grimkel had a quarrel with Torfe
over Signy’s marriage portion and the injury
to his child, Thorbeorg.</p>

<p>Fifteen years Haurd stayed away from home.
He got renown as a fighter. He won honour,
wealth, and an earl’s daughter, Helga, for a wife.
This Helga was as noble a lady as Thorbeorg.</p>

<p>Geir was the first of the exiles to return. He
went to take possession of the farm at Netherbottom,
on the death of Grim, his father. Here
now, with Geir, were living his old mother and
Thorbeorg, Haurd’s sister. Perhaps Geir wished
to marry Thorbeorg, but he was not the king of
men she wanted, though he was honest and feared
nothing; so he did not win her. She preferred
one named Eindride, who came wooing her
once in Geir’s absence. She was not in love with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
him, but her father, Grimkel, liked the match,
and maybe she expected to be freer. When the
wedding was over Grimkel consulted a witch
about the future. Whatever she answered, it
was bad, and the old man died that evening.
Until his son, Haurd, came back, Grimkel’s
property fell into the care of the two sons-in-law,
Illuge and Eindride.</p>

<p>Haurd came back with Helge, with Sigrod
his uncle, Torfe’s foster-son, and thirty followers.
The quarrel with Torfe and Illuge soon had an
opportunity of growing. In a fit of anger Helge
killed a boy for injuring a horse which belonged
to Haurd. Haurd offered to atone for the crime
to Ead, the boy’s father, but too late. Torfe,
replied the man, had already listened to his
complaint and was taking up the case. At
this, Haurd drew his sword in fury and hewed
the man in two and a servant with him. He
burnt Ead’s homestead, his stores, and two
women who were afraid to come out of hiding.</p>

<p>Haurd would have liked to win over to his
part his sister Thorbeorg’s husband, Eindride,
but instead of going himself he sent Helge.
If a good man had come, said Thorbeorg afterwards,
things might have turned out differently.
Eindride excused himself on account of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
engagement with Illuge; not content to let
this end the matter, he suggested that Haurd
should come over himself. Helge turned upon
him and taunted him with being a craven if he
would not break that engagement with Illuge,
but Eindride had nothing to add. All that Helge
brought back to Haurd was that Eindride
offered no help.</p>

<p>Everyone being against them, Haurd and Helge
were outlawed. They had to quit the homestead,
and rather than leave it for Torfe, they burnt it
and all the hay with it. They and the household
took refuge at Geir’s house, Netherbottom.
From here they raided the country on every side,
carrying off whatever they wanted. Before long
men gathered together to subdue them. Geir
was for making a fort against the attack. Haurd,
fearing that they would be starved out, proposed
retreating to an impregnable islet which lay not
far from land by a river’s mouth. Haurd prevailed
and they took possession. The islet consisted
of precipices surmounted by a single level
platform, “not half the size of the Wilderness,”
from which one steep pathway led to the sea.
With timber from Netherbottom, the outlaws
built a hall on this platform; and it had underground
passages. The islet was called Geir’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Holm, and they raided from it as they had done
before, both craftily and boldly. Once on the
islet they were safe from any attack. “It was
the very place for Lewis,” said Philip; “only
there was no water in it, and no food unless there
were sea-gulls’ eggs.”</p>

<p>Many of the landless and outlawed men of
Iceland attached themselves to Haurd and Geir,
swearing to be faithful to these two and to one
another, and to share in all labours. It was a
law of Geir’s Holm that if a man was ill more
than three nights he was to be thrown over the
cliffs. The most that were on the island at one
time was two hundred, the least eighty. Haurd,
Geir, Sigrod, Helge, Thord Colt, and Thorgar
Girdlebeard, were the chief men. The cruellest
of all was Thorgar, and the readiest for every
kind of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>At last men met together to consider how they
might stop the raiding. Thorbeorg would not
be left behind by Eindride, though he warned
her that she would hear nothing pleasant at
the meeting. The crowd became silent as she
entered, and she spoke immediately to some of
the chief men.... Here, Philip got up out of
bed looking very grim while he uttered the
words of Thorbeorg: “I know what you want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
to do. Very good. I cannot stop you by myself.
But this I can do, and will&mdash;I will be the death
of the man who kills Haurd....” Philip stood
entranced and still as a statue at the window,
as if he could see her so long as he remained
still. His weakness, however, made him totter,
and he got into bed, saying: “She was magnificent.
I would have done anything for her.
She said nothing else. She rode away without
waiting for an answer.” Torfe advised swift
and violent measures against the Islanders, but
when Ref suggested that someone should put
them off their guard by pretending that they
were free to go where they wished and be at
peace with all men, he thought well of the plan:
in fact he said they should ride that very night
to a place out of sight of the Islanders. Next
day they saw Thorgar and Sigrod with twelve
other outlaws coming for water. Twice their
number were sent against them. Thorgar and
seven others ran away. He formed a band of
his own and was only killed after a long
freedom. Sigrod and those who were left made
a hard fight, but all were killed.</p>

<p>It was not easy to get a man to go next day
and play the traitor on the Holm, although
Torfe declared that whoever went would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
great honour. In the end, Ref’s brother, Kiartan,
offered to go, if he could have Haurd’s ring
for a reward. He took the boat of Thorstan
Goldknop, both because he disliked that man
and because, being his, it would not excite
suspicion. The story he told the outlaws was
that, chiefly through Illuge and his friends, it
had been decided that they should be free to go
where they wished and have peace. If they
agreed, he himself would row them ashore.
Geir believed Kiartan, especially as he came in
the boat of one who was sworn never to betray
them. Many others also were eager to leave.
But Haurd thought that Kiartan did not look
like a man who was bringing good, and he said
so. Kiartan offered to swear that he was
speaking truth, and still Haurd told him that
he had the eyes of a man whose word was not
worth much. Haurd did not hide his doubts.
Nevertheless, a full boat-load went off with
Kiartan, talking cheerfully. They were landed
out of sight of the Holm, and every one of
them was penned in and killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Kiartan returned for a second load. In spite
of Haurd’s advice, Geir now entered the boat.
So many followed him that only six were left
with Haurd and Helga and their two sons, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Helge, Haurd’s foster-brother. Haurd was sad
to see the boat going, and Geir and his companions
were silent. When they rounded the
spit, out of sight of those on the Holm, they saw
the enemy waiting. Close to land Geir sprang
overboard and swam out along the rocks. A
man of Eindride’s company struck him with a
javelin between the shoulders, and he died.
This Helga saw sitting on the Holm; but Haurd,
who was with her, saw differently. The rest
were penned in and butchered.</p>

<p>A third time Kiartan rowed out. Haurd
bantered him for a ferryman who was doing a
good trade, but still stuck to the opinion that
he was not a true man. If Kiartan had not
taunted him with being afraid to follow his men,
Haurd would never have gone in that boat.
Helga would not go, nor let her sons go. She
wept over her husband as a doomed man. Once
the boat had put out he was angry with himself.
When they came alongside the rocks and saw the
dead body of Geir, Huard stood up in the boat
and clove Kiartan down as far as the girdle
with his sword. The men on shore made friendly
signs to the last, but as soon as the boat touched
land all were made prisoners except Haurd,
who refused to be taken until he had slain four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
men. Eindride, who first laid hands on him,
remembering what Thorbeorg had promised her
brother’s murderer, held out the axe for someone
else to slaughter him; but no one would; and
it was Haurd himself that seized the axe, for
he burst his bonds. Helge followed, and they
got away, though the ring of enemies was three
deep. Haurd would never have been overtaken,
though Ref was on horseback, if a spell had not
been cast on him: moreover, Helge began to
limp with a fearful wound. Even so, Haurd
again broke through them, killing three more.
Ref again caught him, yet dared not meddle
with him, though he now had Helge on his back,
until the others made a ring about him with the
aid of a spell. There was nothing for it but to
drop Helge and save him from his enemies by
killing him. Haurd was enraged because he
knew that a spell was being used on him; he
was so fearful to look at that no one would go
for him until Torfe had promised Haurd’s ring
to the man who did. Almost a dozen set on
him together to earn the ring. Six of them
had fallen before him when the head flew off his
axe; nor did any one venture even then to close
with him. From behind, however, Thorstan
Goldknop, a big red-headed man, but mean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
swung at his neck with an axe, so that he died.
He had killed sixteen men altogether. Even
his enemies said now that Haurd&mdash;Philip, in
tears, said Roland, not Haurd&mdash;had been the
bravest man of his time. If he had not had
rogues among his followers he would have been
living yet; but he never had been a lucky
man. Thorstan got his ring. At that time he
had not heard of Thorbeorg’s vow; when he
did hear he took no pleasure in the ring.</p>

<p>Sixty of the Islanders had been slain. All
the rest had escaped, except Helga, and the two
sons of Helga and Haurd, who had stayed on
the island. It was too late to fetch away those
three that evening, and before the sunrise next
day they also had escaped. Under cover of
darkness the mother swam over first with Beorn,
who was four, and next with Grimkel, who was
eight. Then carrying Beorn and leading Grimkel
by the hand, Helga climbed over the hills until
they came to Eindride’s house. Under the fence
of the yard, Helga sank down with Beorn.
Grimkel she sent up to Thorbeorg to ask her to
save them. Haurd’s sister was sitting alone at
the end of the hall, looking so grand and stern
that the child stopped still without a word.
“She was like a great queen of sorrows,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Philip, “but she had to come down to him.” She
led him outside to the light, she picked him up
to take a good look at him, she asked who he
was. He told her that he was Haurd’s son.
She asked him where his mother was, and what
had happened. He told her what he could
while they were walking down to the fence.
The sister and the wife of Haurd looked at one
another. Thorbeorg gave the three a hiding
place in an out-house, and herself took the key.
Not long afterwards Eindride came home with
a number of men. Thorbeorg served a meal for
them, and they related all that had happened;
but she said nothing until one of them told
how Thorstan Goldknop had struck Haurd from
behind when he was unarmed. “He was no
better than a hangman or a butcher,” said
Philip. Thorbeorg cried that she knew a spell
had been cast on her brother, or they would
never have overcome him. That night as they
were going to bed Thorbeorg made a thrust at
Eindride with a knife, but wounded him in the
hand only. He asked her if anything he could
do now would satisfy her. “The head of
Thorstan Goldknop,” she replied. Next morning
Eindride slew Thorstan and brought back the
head. “He deserved it,” said Philip, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Thorbeorg kept her vow.” Still she was not
satisfied. She refused to make peace with her
husband unless he would befriend Helga and her
sons, should they need it. Eindride, supposing
that they had been drowned, readily promised
to do what she asked. Thorbeorg showed him
his mistake. She went out, and came back,
leading Helga and the two boys. Eindride was
sorry, because he had sworn already not to do
anything for Haurd’s family, but he had to keep
his oath to Thorbeorg. Nor did men blame
him, and they praised Thorbeorg. Still she
was not satisfied. Twenty-four men died in the
next months because of Haurd, and most of them
at her instigation. She and Eindride lived on
after that in peace to a great age, leaving behind
them good children and grandchildren, who in
their turn had many brave and honourable
descendants. “I am sorry,” said Philip, “that
Haurd got that blow from behind. But he was
a man who had to make a story before he died.
And if this had not happened Thorstan might
have gone on living, and have missed his due.
Also perhaps Thorbeorg would not have had a
chance of showing what she was good for. Now
it is all over. They are put in a tale. I don’t
know what happened to Torfe and Illuge, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
everyone who hears the story either hates them
or forgets them: so they have <i>their</i> reward.
If Grimkel and Beorn lived to be men, I am sure
Torfe and Illuge did not die in their beds.”</p>

<p>With a deep sigh Philip stopped. For some
minutes he said nothing. When he broke his
silence it was to say: “Perhaps Roland will
really do something like Haurd. He looks like
it. He could. Don’t you think he is one of
those people who look as if men would some day
have to tell stories of them to one another?
<i>He</i> would not build a tower up on a mountain
for nothing, and live there no better than a man
could live at Clapham Junction.” Here Philip
cried, which I never saw him do before or after
that day. It was the beginning of the worst part
of his illness. Not for many weeks was he out
of bed, and once more my companion in the
house, in the yard, in Our Country, or at school
on those rare days when he attended.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHAT WILL ROLAND DO?</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Roland and Jack were too much my seniors,
and yet still too young, to take notice of me.
But I could admire them from afar for their
gifts and opportunities, their good looks, their
bodily prowess, liberty, and apparent lack of all
care. Their activities were mostly away from
home, and rumours, probably, were incomplete.
Roland ran and jumped at sports, rode a horse,
sometimes into the yard, sometimes out to where
the fox was hunted (a little beyond <i>our</i> range)&mdash;bicycled
hither and thither&mdash;possessed a gun and
used it, doubtless in a magnificent manner&mdash;dressed
as he should be dressed&mdash;was more than
once in trouble of some kind, I think in debt,
and had once been observed by me in London
walking with a dark lady of his own splendid
breed, whom I never heard anything of, or saw
again. What I first knew of Roland was&mdash;shortly
after I began to frequent Abercorran
House&mdash;a voice singing mightily in the bathroom:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Foul fall the hand that bends the steel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around the courser’s thundering heel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That e’er shall print a sable wound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On fair Glamorgan’s velvet ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Never afterwards did he do anything that fell
short of the name Roland, to which the noble
war-song, at that moment, fixed its character for
ever. Jack and he had been to a famous school
until they were sixteen, and did no good there.
Indoors they learnt very little more than a
manner extremely well suited to hours of idleness.
Out of doors they excelled at the more selfish
sports, at athletics, boxing, sculling, shooting.
So they had come home and, as Mr Morgan
had nothing to suggest, they had done what
suggested itself.</p>

<p>You could see Mr Morgan thinking as he
watched the two, undecided whether it was
best to think with or without the cigar, which
he might remove for a few seconds, perhaps
without advantage, for it was replaced with
evident satisfaction. But he was thinking as
he stood there, pale, rigid, and abstracted.
Then perhaps Roland would do or say something
accompanied by a characteristic free, bold, easy
gesture, turning on his heel; and the father gave
up thinking, to laugh heartily, and as likely as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
not step forward to enter the conversation, or
ask Roland about the dogs, or what he had been
doing in the past week. “Had a good time? ...
suits you?... Ha, ha, ... Well, this will
never do, I must be going. Good-bye, good-bye.
Don’t forget to look in and see how mother is.”</p>

<p>He had only gone upstairs to the Library to
open one of the new reviews which, except where
they caught the sunshine, remained so new.
He and his two elder sons always parted with
a laugh. Either he manœuvred for it, or as
soon as the good laugh arrived he slipped away
lest worse might befall. He saw clearly enough
that “they had no more place in London than
Bengal tigers,” as he said one day to Mr Stodham:
“They ought to have been in the cavalry. But
they aren’t&mdash;curse it&mdash;what is to be done?
Why could I not breed clerks?” The immediate
thing to be done was to light the suspended cigar.
It was lucky if the weather just at that time took
a fine turn; if Harry and Lewis, for a wonder,
were persuaded to spend all day and every day
at school; if Mrs Morgan was away in Wales;
if Jessie’s voice was perfect, singing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The cuckoo is a merry bird ...”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I recall such a time. The wall-flower had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
turned out to be just the mixture of blood
colour and lemon that Mr Morgan liked best.
The water-lilies were out on the pond. The
pigeons lay all along under the roof ridge, too
idle to coo except by mistake or in a dream.
Jack and Roland were working hard at some
machinery in the yard. The right horse, it
seems, had won the Derby.</p>

<p>On the evenings in such a season Philip and
I had to bring to light the fishing-tackle, bind
hooks on gut and gimp, varnish the binding,
mix new varnish, fit the rods together, practise
casting in the Wilderness, with a view to our
next visit, which would be in August, to my
aunt Rachel’s at Lydiard Constantine. There
would be no eggs to be found so late, except a
few woodpigeons’, linnets’, and swallows’, but
these late finds in the intervals of fishing&mdash;when
it was too hot, for example&mdash;had a special
charm. The nuts would be ripe before we left....
On these evenings we saw only the fishing
things, the Wilderness, and Lydiard Constantine.</p>

<p>This weather was but a temporary cure for
Mr Morgan’s curiosity as to what Jack and
Roland were to do. You could tell that he was
glad to see Roland’s face again, home from
Canada with some wolf skins after a six months’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
absence; but it was not enough. The fellow
had been in an office once for a much shorter
period. The one thing to draw him early from
bed was hunting. Well, but he was a fine
fellow. How should all the good in him be
employed? It could not be left to the gods; and
yet assuredly the gods would have their way.</p>

<p>Everybody else did something. Aurelius
earned a living, though his hands proclaimed
him one who was born neither to toil nor
spin. Higgs, too, did no one knew what,
but something that kept him in tobacco and
bowler hats, in the times when he was not
fishing in the Wilderness or looking after his
pigeons in the yard. For it so happened&mdash;and
caused nobody surprise&mdash;that all the pigeons
at Abercorran House were his. Mr Morgan
looked with puzzled disapproval from Higgs to
Roland and Jack, and back again to Higgs.
Higgs had arrived and stayed under their
shadow. It was a little mysterious, but so it
was, and Mr Morgan could not help seeing and
wondering why the two should afflict themselves
with patronising one like fat Higgs. Once when
Roland struck him, half in play, he bellowed
distractedly, not for pain but for pure rabid
terror. He went about whistling; for he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
a little, hard mouth made on purpose. I thought
him cruel, because one day when he saw that,
owing to some misapprehension, I was expecting
two young pigeons for the price of one, he put
the head of one into his mouth and closed his
teeth.... Whilst I was still silly with disgust
and horror he gave me the other bird. But he
understood dogs. I have seen Roland listen
seriously while Higgs was giving an opinion
on some matter concerning Ladas, Bully, Spot,
or Granfer; yet Roland was reputed to know
all about dogs, and almost all about bitches.</p>

<p>That did not console Mr Morgan. Wherever
he looked he saw someone who was
perfectly content with Roland and everything
else, just as they were, at Abercorran House.
Mr Stodham, for example, was all admiration,
with a little surprise. Aurelius, again, said that
if such a family, house, and backyard, had not
existed, they would have to be invented, as
other things less pleasant and necessary had
been. When rumours were afloat that perhaps
Mr Morgan would be compelled to give up the
house Aurelius exclaimed: “It is impossible,
it is disgraceful. Let the National Gallery go,
let the British Museum go, but preserve the
Morgans and Abercorran House.” Mr Torrance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
of course, agreed with Aurelius. He wrote a
poem about the house, but, said Aurelius, “It
was written with tears for ink, which is barbarous.
He has not enough gall to translate tears into
good ink.” Higgs naturally favoured things as
they were, since the yard at Abercorran House
was the best possible place for his birds. As
for me, I was too young, but Abercorran House
made London tolerable and often faultless.</p>

<p>Ann’s opinion was expressed in one word:
“Wales.” She thought that the family ought
to go back to Wales, that all would be well
there. In fact, she regarded Abercorran House
as only a halt, though she admitted that there
were unfriendly circumstances. The return to
Wales was for her the foundation or the coping
stone always. She would not have been greatly
put out if there had been a public subscription
or grant from the Civil list to make Abercorran
House and Mr Morgan, Jessie, Ann herself,
Jack, Roland, Philip, Harry, Lewis, Ladas,
Bully, Spot, Granfer, the pigeons, the yard,
the Wilderness and the jackdaws, the pond and
the water-lilies, as far as possible immortal, and
a possession for ever, without interference from
Board of Works, School Board inspectors, Rate
Collectors, surveyors of taxes, bailiffs and re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>coverers
of debts, moreover without any right
on the part of the public to touch this possession
except by invitation, with explicit approval by
Roland and the rest. It should have been done.
A branch of the British Museum might have
been especially created to protect this stronghold,
as doubtless it would have been protected
had it included a dolmen, tumulus, or
British camp, or other relic of familiar type.
As it was not done, a bailiff did once share the
kitchen with Ann, a short man completely
enveloped in what had been, at about the time
of Albert the Good, a fur-lined overcoat, and a
silk hat suitable for a red Indian. Most of his
face was nose, and his eyes and nose both together
looked everlastingly over the edge of the
turned-up coat-collar at the ground. His hands
must have been in his coat-pockets. I speak
of his appearance when he took the air; for I
did not see him at Abercorran House. There
he may have produced his hands and removed
his hat from his head and lifted up his eyes from
the ground&mdash;a thing impossible to his nose.
He may even have spoken&mdash;in a voice of ashes.
But at least on the day after his visit all was
well at Abercorran House with man and bird
and beast. The jackdaws riding a south-west<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
wind in the sun said “Jack” over and over
again, both singly and in volley. Only Higgs
was disturbed. He, it seems, knew the visitor,
and from that day dated his belief in the
perishableness of mortal things, and a moderated
opinion of everything about the Morgans
except the pigeon-house and Roland. Mr
Morgan perhaps did not, but everybody else
soon forgot the bailiff. On the day after his
visit, nevertheless, Philip was still indignant.
He was telling me about the battle of Hastings.
All I knew and had cared to know was summed up
in the four figures&mdash;1066. But Philip, armed
with a long-handled mallet, had constituted
himself the English host on the hill brow,
battering the Normans downhill with yells of
“Out, out,” and “God Almighty,” and also
“Out Jew.” For his enemy was William of
Normandy and the Jew bailiff in one. With
growls of “Out, out” through foaming set lips,
he swung the mallet repeatedly, broke a Windsor
chair all to pieces, and made the past live again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="smaller">THE INTERLUDE OF HIGH BOWER</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">Ann must have had the bailiff’s visit in mind
when she said, not long after:</p>

<p>“Philip, what would you give to be back,
all of you, at Abercorran?”</p>

<p>“Silly,” he answered, “I haven’t got anything
good enough to give, you know....
But I would give up going to Our Country for
a whole year. I would do anything....
But this isn’t bad, is it, Arthur?”</p>

<p>Depth of feeling was (to me) so well conveyed
by those two mean words that for the life of me
I could only corroborate them with a fervent
repetition:</p>

<p>“Not bad.”</p>

<p>The words expressed, too, a sense of loyalty
to the remote idea of Abercorran town
itself.</p>

<p>“But High Bower was better, wasn’t it,”
said Ann, to tease him, and to remind him of
his duty to the old Abercorran.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, Arthur,” was his reply, “I have
got a squirrel to skin.”</p>

<p>High Bower was the place in Wiltshire where
the Morgan family had paused between Abercorran
and London. It was not quite a satisfactory
memory to some of them, because there
seemed no reason why they should have left
Wales if they were going to live in the country;
and, then, in a year’s time they went to London,
after all. Philip never mentioned High Bower,
but Mr Stodham knew it&mdash;what did he not
know in Wiltshire?&mdash;and one day he asked me
to accompany him on a visit. He had promised
to look over the house for a friend.</p>

<p>The village was an archipelago of thatched
cottages, sprinkled here and there, and facing
all ways, alongside an almost equal number of
roads, lanes, tracks, footpaths, and little streams,
so numerous and interlaced that they seemed
rather to cut it off from the world than to connect
it. With much the same materials to use&mdash;thatch
and brick, thatch and half-timber, or
tiles for both roof and walls&mdash;the builders of it
had made each house different, because thus
it had to be, or the man would have it so, or he
could not help it, or thus time had decided with
the help of alterations and additions. All were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
on one side of the shallow, flashing river, though
it so twined that it appeared to divide some
and to surround others, and no bridges were
visible. Some of the houses were out in the
midst of the mown fields with their troops of
tossers, rakers, and pitchforkers, and the high-laden
waggons like houses moving. Others
were isolated in the sappy, unfooted water-meadows
full of tall sedge and iris that hid
the hooting moorhen. Remains of the old mill
and mill-house, of red, zig-zagged bricks and
black timber in stripes, stood apparently on an
island, unapproached by road or path, the walls
bathed and half-buried in dark humid weeds
and the foaming bloom of meadow-sweet. The
village had two sounds, the clucking of fowls
disturbed from a bath in the road dust, and the
gush of the river over an invisible leafy weir, and
this was no sound at all, but a variety of silence.</p>

<p>At length I realised that the village was at
an end, and before us was a steep, flowery
bank, along which at oblivious intervals a train
crawled out of beeches, looked a little at the
world and entered beeches again, then a tunnel.
The train left the quiet quieter, nor did it stop
within five miles of High Bower. The railway,
which had concentrated upon itself at certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
points the dwellings and business of the countryside,
left this place, which had resolved to
remain where it was, more remote than before.</p>

<p>As we went under the bridge of the embankment
I thought we must have missed the
Morgans’ old house. I wondered if it could
have been that last and best farmhouse, heavy
and square, that stood back, beyond a green
field as level as a pool and three chestnut-trees.
Horses were sheltering from the sun under the
trees, their heads to the trunks. The cows
had gone to the shade of the house, and were all
gazing motionless towards the impenetrable
gloom of the windows. The barns, sheds, and
lodges, were in themselves a village. The last
outhouse almost touched the road, a cart-lodge
shadowy and empty but for a waggon with
low sides curving up forward like the bows
of a boat, and itself as delicate as a boat,
standing well up on four stout, not ponderous,
wheels, and bearing a builder’s name from East
Stour in Dorset. Now this house and its appurtenances
I thought entirely suitable to the
Morgans, and my thoughts returned to them as
we went under the bridge. Well, and there was
the house we were making for, at the foot of the
embankment on the other side. It solved a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
small mystery at once. Our road, before coming
to the railway, had cut through a double avenue
of limes, which appeared to start at the embankment
and terminate a quarter of a mile away
at the top of a gentle rise. They were fine trees,
many of them clouded with bunches of mistletoe
as big as herons’ nests. What was the meaning
of the avenue? At neither end was a house
to be seen. But, there, at the foot of the embankment,
separated from it by two pairs of
limes, was the house belonging to the avenue&mdash;the
Morgans’ house, New House by name. The
railway had cut through its avenue; a traveller
passing could easily have thrown a stone into
any one of the chimneys of New House.</p>

<p>A weedy track led out of the road on the
right, along under the embankment, up to the
house. No smoke rose up from it, not a sound
came from the big square windows, or the door
between its two pairs of plain stone columns,
or the stable on one hand or the garden on the
other. The sun poured down on it; it did not
respond. It looked almost ugly, a biggish,
awkward house, neither native nor old, its walls
bare and weathered without being mellowed.
In a window, facing anyone who approached it
from the road, it announced that it was “To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
be let or sold” through a firm of solicitors
in London. The flower borders were basely
neglected, yet not wild. Cows had broken in....
It was an obvious stranger, and could
only have seemed at home on the main road a
little way out of some mean town. It was going
to the dogs unlamented.</p>

<p>As we were opening the door a cottage woman
attached herself to us, eager, as it proved, to
be the first villager to enter since the Morgans,
“the foreigners,” had departed. The railway
embankment, as she explained, had driven them
out, cut off the sun, and kept away new tenants.
She left no corner unexplored, sometimes
alleging some kind of service to us, but as a rule
out of unashamed pure delight, talking continually
either in comment on what was there,
or to complete the picture of the Morgans, as
seen or invented during those twelve months
of their residence.</p>

<p>They were foreigners, she said, who talked
and sang in a foreign language, but could
speak English when they wanted to. They were
not rich, never entertained. Such ill-behaved
children.... No, there was nothing against
them; they didn’t owe a penny.... She
admired the big rooms downstairs, with pillared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
doorways and mantelpieces&mdash;they had a dingy
palatial air. In the same rooms with the shiny
columns were broad, blackened, open fire-places,
numerous small irregular cupboards, cracked
and split. Walls and doors were undoubtedly
marked by arrows and pistol-shot; someone
had drawn a target in a corner&mdash;“Master
Roland,” said the woman. “He was a nice lad,
too; or would have been if he had been English.”
The spider-webs from wall and ceiling might
have been as old as the house. “The maids
had too much to do, playing with all those
children, to keep the place clean. Ignorant
those children were, too. I asked one of the
little ones who was the Queen, and he said
‘Gwenny....’ I don’t know ... some
Jerusalem name that isn’t in the history books....
I asked an older one what was the greatest
city in the world, and he said ‘Rome.’ They
were real gentry, too. But there was something
funny about them. One of them came running
into my shop once and said to me, ‘I’ve found
the dragon, Mrs Smith. Come and see&mdash;I’ll
protect you. He has four horns of ebony, two
long and two not so long, and two big diamond
eyes a long way from his horns. He has a neck
as thick as his body, but smooth; his body is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
like crape. He has no legs, but he swims over the
world like a fish. He is as quiet as an egg.’
And he took me down the road and showed
me a black slug such as you tread on by the
hundred without so much as knowing it.
They had no more regard for the truth than
if they were lying....</p>

<p>“You never saw the like of them for happiness.
When I used to stop at the gate and see them
in the grass, perhaps soaking wet, tumbling
about and laughing as if they weren’t Christians
at all, I said to myself: ‘Oh, dear, dear me, what
trouble there must be in store for those beautiful
children, that they should be so happy now.
God preserve them, if it be his will.’ I whispered:
‘Hush, children, be a bit more secret-like about
it.’ It don’t do to boast about anything, let
alone happiness. I remember one of them dying
sudden. She was little more than a baby; such
a child for laughing, as if she was possessed;
pretty, too, a regular little moorhen, as you
might say, for darkness and prettiness, and fond
of the water. I saw one of the maids after the
funeral, and took occasion to remark that it was
a blessing the child was taken to a better world
so soon, before she had known a minute’s sorrow.
She fired up&mdash;she was outlandish, too, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
maids always were, and talked their tongue,
and stood up for them as if they were paid for
it&mdash;and she says, looking that wicked, ‘Master
says he will never forgive it, and I never will.
If she had been a peevish child, I don’t say we
shouldn’t have been wild because she had
missed everything, but to take away a child
like that before she could defend herself is a
most unchristian act’ ... and that sort of
thing. Oh, there was wickedness in them,
though they never wronged anybody.”</p>

<p>She pointed to the shot marks in a door, and
pronounced that no good could come to a
family where the children did such things. At
each room she made guesses, amounting often
to positive asseveration, as to whose it had
been. Few enough were the marks of ownership
to untutored eyes&mdash;chiefly the outlines, like
shadows, of furniture and of books that once
had leaned against the wall. One door was
marked by a series of horizontal lines like those
on a thermometer, where children’s height had
been registered at irregular intervals, the hand
or stick pressing down the curls for truth’s sake.</p>

<p>Upstairs the passages rambled about as in an
old house, and when doors were shut they were
dark and cavernous. The rooms themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
were light almost to dazzling after the passages.
The light added to their monotony, or what
would have been monotony if we had known
nothing of their inhabitants. Even so, there
were Megan and Ivor whom we had never
known. Ivor came between Roland and Philip,
“He was the blackest of the black,” said Mrs
Smith, “brown in the face and black in the hair
like a bay horse. He was one for the water;
made a vow he would swim from here to the sea,
or leastways keep to the water all the way.
He got over the second mill-wheel. He swam
through the parson’s lawn when there was a
garden-party. But he had to give up because
he kept tasting the water to see how soon it got
salt, and so half drowned himself. He came
into my shop just as he was born to remind me
about the fireworks I had promised to stock for
Guy Fawkes day, and that was in September.
But he fell out of a tree and was dead before the
day came, and, if you will believe me, his brother
bought up the fireworks there and then and let
them off on the grave.”</p>

<p>A wall in one room had on it a map of the
neighbourhood, not with the real names, but
those of the early kingdoms of England and
Wales. The river was the Severn. Their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
fields were the land of Gwent. Beyond them
lay Mercia and the Hwiccas. The men of Gwent
could raid across the Severn, and (in my opinion)
were pleased with the obstacle. Later, the
projected embankment had been added to the
map. This was Offa’s Dyke, grimly shutting
them out of the kingdoms of the Saxons. I
recognised Philip’s hand in the work. For his
later Saxon fervour was due simply to hate of
the Normans: before they came he would have
swung his axe as lustily against the Saxons.
From this room I could just see the tips of some
of the avenue trees beyond the embankment.</p>

<p>We had seen far more of the house than was
necessary to decide Mr Stodham against it,
when Mrs Smith begged me to stay upstairs a
moment while she ran out; she wished me to
mark for her a window which she was to point
out to me from below. “That’s it,” she said,
after some hesitation, as I appeared at last at
the window of a small room looking away from
the railway. Nothing in the room distinguished
it from the rest save one small black disc with
an auburn rim to it on the dark ceiling&mdash;one
disc only, not, as in the other rooms, several,
overlapping, and mingled with traces of the flames
of ill-lighted lamps. “Mrs Morgan,” I thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
at once. Some one evidently had sat long there
at a table by night. “I never could make out
who it was had this room,” said Mrs Smith,
coming up breathless: “It used to have a red
blind and a lamp always burning. My husband
said it did look so cosy; he thought it must be
Mr Morgan studying at his books. The milkers
saw it in the early morning in winter; they said
it was like the big red bottles in a chemist’s
window. The keeper said you might see it any
hour of night. I didn’t like it myself. It didn’t
look to me quite right, like a red eye. You
couldn’t tell what might be going on behind it,
any more than behind a madman’s eye. I’ve
thought about it often, trying to picture the
inside of that room. My husband would say to
me: ‘Bessy, the red window at New House
did look nice to-night as I came home from
market. I’m sure they’re reading and studying
something learned, astrology or such, behind
that red blind.’ ‘Don’t you believe it, James’
says I, ‘learned it may be, but not <i>according</i>.
If they want to burn a light all night they could
have a black blind. Who else has got a red
blind? It isn’t fit. I can’t think how you
bear that naughty red light on a night like this,
when there are as many stars in the sky as there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
are letters in the Bible.’ Now, which of them
used to sit here? Somebody sat all alone, you
may depend upon it, never making a sound
nor a stir.”</p>

<p>Another room made her think of “Miss Jessie,
the one that picked up the fox when he was
creeping as slow as slow through their garden,
and hid him till the hounds found another fox....
Oh, dear, to think what a house this used
to be, and so nice and quiet now ... dreadful
quiet.... I really must be going, if there is
nothing more I can do for you.”</p>

<p>Downstairs again the sight of the shot marks
in the door set Mrs Smith off again, but in a
sobered tone:</p>

<p>“You won’t take the house, I’m thinking,
sir? No. I wouldn’t myself, not for anything....
It would be like wearing clothes a person
had died in. They never meant us to see these
things all in their disabill. ’Tis bad enough
to be haunted by the dead, but preserve me from
the ghosts of the living. It is more fit for a
Hospital, now, or a Home.... Those people
were like a kind of spirits, like they used to see
in olden time. They did not know the sorrow
and wickedness of the world as it really is.
‘Can the rush grow up without noise? Can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
the flag grow without water? Whilst it is yet
in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth
before any other herb.’ Yet you would think
they meant to live for ever by the way they
went about, young and old.... One night I was
coming home late and I saw all these windows
lit up, every one, and there were people in them
all. It was as if the place was a hollow cloud
with fire in it and people dancing. Only the
red blind was down, and as bright as ever. It
called to my mind a story the old Ann used to
tell, about a fellow going home from a fair and
seeing a grand, gorgeous house close by the road,
and lovely people dancing and musicking in it,
where there hadn’t been a house before of any
kind. He went in and joined them and slept in
a soft warm bed, but in the morning he woke up
under a hedge. I sort of expected to see there
wasn’t any house there next morning, it looked
<i>that strange</i>.”</p>

<p>While we were having tea in her parlour Mrs
Smith showed us a photograph of “Miss Megan,”
an elder sister of Jack and Roland, whom I had
never heard of, nor I think had Mr Stodham.
I shall not forget the face. She was past twenty,
but clearly a fairy child, one who, like the flying
Nicolete, would be taken for a fay by the wood-folk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
(and they should know). Her dark face was
thin and shaped like a wedge, with large eyes
generous and passionate under eyebrows that
gave them an apprehensive expression, though
the fine clear lips could not have known fear or
any other sort of control except pity. The face
was peering through chestnut leaves, looking
as soft as a hare, but with a wildness like the
hare’s which, when it is in peril, is almost terrible.
I think it was a face destined to be loved often,
but never to love, or but once. It could draw
men’s lips and pens, and would fly from them
and refuse to be entangled in any net of words
or kisses. It would fly to the high, solitary
places, and its lovers would cry out: “Oh,
delicate bird, singing in the prickly furze, you
are foolish, too, or why will you not come down
to me where the valleys are pleasant, where the
towns are, and everything can be made according
to your desire?” Assuredly, those eyes were
for a liberty not to be found among men, but
only among the leaves, in the clouds, or on the
waves, though fate might confine them in the
labyrinth of a city. But not a word of her could
I learn except once when I asked Ann straight
out. All she said was: “God have mercy on
Megan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>Two years after our visit the New House was
taken by a charitable lady as a school and home
for orphans. In less than a year she abandoned
it, and within a year after that, it was burnt to
the ground. The fields of Gwent and the lime
avenue may still be seen by railway travellers.
Gypsies have broken the hedges and pitched
their tents unforbidden. All kinds of people
come in December for the mistletoe. The place
is utterly neglected, at least by the living.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think, Mr Stodham and I
were both sorry for our day at High Bower. It
created a suspicion&mdash;not a lasting one with me&mdash;that
Abercorran House would not endure for
ever. Mr Stodham’s account made Mr Torrance
look grave, and I understood that he wrote a
poem about New House. Higgs remarked that
if the Morgans had stayed at High Bower he
could not imagine what he should have done
with his pigeons. Aurelius enjoyed every detail,
from the map to Megan’s photograph. Aurelius
had no acquaintance with regret or envy. He
was glad of Mr Stodham’s account of New House,
and glad of Abercorran House in reality. He
was one that sat in the sunniest places (unless
he was keeping Jessie out) all day, and though
he did not despise the moon he held the fire at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
Abercorran House a more stable benefactor.
Neither sun nor moon made him think of the
day after to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow.
“Aurelius,” said Mr Morgan, “is the
wisest man out of Christendom and therefore
the wisest of all men. He knows that England
in the nineteenth century does not allow any
but a working man to die of starvation unless
he wants to. Aurelius is not a working man,
nor does he desire to starve. He is not for an
age, but for to-day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="smaller">THE POET’S SPRING AT LYDIARD CONSTANTINE</span></h2>
</div>



<p class="noindent">The perfume of the fur of the squirrel we skinned
on that January evening&mdash;when Ann teased
Philip about High Bower&mdash;I well remember.
I liked it then; now I like it the more for every
year which has since gone by. It was one of
the years when I kept a diary, and day by day
I can trace its seasons. The old year ended
in frost and snow. The new year began with
thaw, and with a postal order from my aunt at
Lydiard Constantine, and the purchase of three
yards of cotton wool in readiness for the nesting
season and our toll of eggs. On the next day
snow fell again, in the evening the streets were
ice, and at Abercorran House Philip and I made
another drawer of a cabinet for birds’ eggs.
Frost and snow continued on the morrow, compelling
us to make a sledge instead of a drawer
for the cabinet. The sledge carried Philip and
me alternately throughout the following day,
over frozen roads and footpaths. The fifth day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
was marked by a letter from Lydiard Constantine,
eighteen degrees of frost, and more sledging with
Philip, and some kind of attention (that has left
not a wrack behind) to Sallust’s “Catiline”....</p>

<p>Within a fortnight the pigeons were beginning
to lay, and as one of the nests contained the
four useless eggs of an imbecile pair of hens, we
tasted thus early the pleasure of blowing one egg
in the orthodox manner and sucking three.
This being Septuagesima Sunday, nothing would
satisfy us but an immediate visit to Our Country,
where the jays’ nests and others we had robbed
seven months before were found with a thrill
all but equal to that of May, and always strictly
examined in case of accidents or miracles. For
there had now been a whole week of spring sun
shining on our hearts, and on the plumage of the
cock pheasant we stalked in vain. The thrush
sang. The blackbird sang. With the Conversion
of St Paul came rain, and moreover
school, Thucydides, Shakespeare’s “Richard the
Second,” and other unrealities and afflictions,
wherein I had to prove again how vain it is “to
cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination
of a feast” at old Gaunt’s command.
But Quinquagesima Sunday meant rising in the
dark and going out with Philip, to watch the jays,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
always ten yards ahead of our most stealthy
stepping&mdash;to climb after old woodpigeons’ nests,
to cut hazel sticks, to the tune of many skylarks.
Alas, a sprained foot could not save me from
school on Monday. But now the wild pigeons
dwelling about the school began to coo all day
long and to carry sticks for their nests. Out
on the football field, in the bright pale light
and the south-west wind the black rooks courted&mdash;and
more; the jackdaws who generally accompanied
them were absent somewhere. What
then mattered it whether Henri Quatre or Louis
Quatorze were the greatest of the Bourbon kings,
as some of my school-fellows debated? Besides,
when February was only half through, Aunt
Rachel formally invited Philip and me to Lydiard
Constantine for Easter. This broke the winter’s
back. Frost and fog and Bright’s “History of
England” were impotent. We began to write
letters to the chosen three or four boys at
Lydiard Constantine. We made, in the gas jets
at Abercorran House, tubes of glass for the sucking
of bird’s eggs. We bought egg drills. We
made egg-drills for ourselves.... The cat had
kittens. One pair of Higgs’ pigeons hatched out
their eggs. The house-sparrows were building.
The almond-trees blossomed in the gardens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
“Brockenhurst” and the other houses. The
rooks now stayed in the football field until five.
The larks sang all day, invisible in the strong
sun and burning sky. The gorse was a bonfire
of bloom. Then, at last, on St David’s day,
the rooks were building, the woodpigeons cooing
on every hand, the first lambs were heard.</p>

<p>Day after day left us indignant that, in spite
of all temptations, no thrush or blackbird had
laid an egg, so far as we knew. But all things
seemed possible. One day, in a mere afternoon
walk, we found, not far beyond a muddle
of new streets, a district “very beautiful and
quiet,” says the diary. Losing our way, we
had to hire a punt to take us across the stream&mdash;I
suppose, the Wandle. Beautiful and
quiet, too, was the night when Philip scaled
the high railings into the grounds of a neighbouring
institution, climbed one of the tall elms of
its rookery&mdash;I could see him up against the
sky, bigger than any of the nests, in the topmost
boughs&mdash;and brought down the first egg. It
was the Tuesday before an early Easter, a clear
blue, soft day which drove clean out of our
minds all thought of fog, frost, and rain, past
or to come. Mr Stodham had come into the
yard of Abercorran House on the way to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
office, as I had on my way to school. Finding
Aurelius sitting in the sun with Ladas, he said
in his genial, nervous way: “That’s right.
You are making the best of a fine day. Goodness
knows what it will be like to-morrow.”
“And Goodness cares,” said Aurelius, almost
angrily, “I don’t.” “Sorry, sorry,” said Mr
Stodham, hastily lighting his pipe. “All
right,” said Aurelius, “but if you care about
to-morrow, I don’t believe you really care about
to-day. You are one of those people, who say
that if it is not always fine, or fine when they
want it, they don’t care if it is never fine, and
be damned to it, say they. And yet they
don’t like bad weather so well as I do, or as
Jessie does. Now, rain, when it ought not to
be raining, makes Jessie angry, and if the day
were a man or woman she would come to terms
with it, but it isn’t, and what is more, Jessie
rapidly gets sick of being angry, and as likely
as not she sings ‘Blow away the morning dew,’
and finds that she likes the rain. She has been
listening to the talk about rain by persons who
want to save Day and Martin. I prefer Betty
Martin.... Do you know, Arthur tells me
the house martins will soon be here?” We
looked up together to see if it was a martin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
that both of us had heard, or seemed to hear,
overhead, but, if it was, it was invisible.</p>

<p>Every year such days came&mdash;any time in
Lent, or even before. I take it for granted that,
as an historical fact, they were followed, as
they have been in the twentieth century, by
fog, frost, mists, drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, east
wind, and north wind, and I know very well
that we resented these things. But we loved
the sun. We strove to it in imagination through
the bad weather, believing in every kind of
illusory hint that the rain was going to stop,
and so on. Moreover rain had its merits. For
example, on a Sunday, it kept the roads nearly
as quiet as on a week day, and we could have
Our Country, or Richmond Park, or Wimbledon
Common, all to ourselves. Then, again, what
a thing it was to return wet, with a rainy brightness
in your eyes, to change rapidly, to run
round to Abercorran House, and find Philip
and Ann expecting you in the kitchen, with a
gooseberry tart, currant tart, raspberry tart,
plum tart, blackberry tart, cranberry and apple
tart, apple tart, according to season; and mere
jam or syrup tart in the blank periods. My
love of mud also I trace to that age, because
Philip and I could escape all company by turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>ing
out of a first class road into the black
mash of a lane. If we met anyone there, it
was a carter contending with the mud, a tramp
sitting between the bank and a fire, or a filthy
bird-catcher beyond the hedge.</p>

<p>If the lane was both muddy and new to us,
and we two, Philip and I, turned into it, there
was nothing which we should have thought out
of its power to present in half a mile or so,
nothing which it would have overmuch astonished
us by presenting. It might have been a Gypsy
camp, it might have been the terrestrial Paradise
of Sheddad the son of Ad&mdash;we should have
fitted either into our scheme of the universe.
Not that we were <i>blasé</i>; for every new thrush’s
egg in the season had a new charm for us. Not
that we had been flightily corrupted by fairy
tales and marvels. No: the reason was that
we only regarded as impossible such things as
a score of 2000 in first class cricket, an air ship,
or the like; and the class of improbabilities did
not exist for us. Nor was this all. We were
not merely ready to welcome strange things
when we had walked half a mile up a lane and
met no man, but we were in a gracious condition
for receiving whatever might fall to us.
We did not go in search of miracles, we invited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
them to come to us. What was familiar to
others was never, on that account, tedious or
contemptible to us. I remember that when
Philip and I first made our way through London
to a shop which was depicted in an advertisement,
in spite of the crowds on either hand all
along our route, in spite of the full directions of
our elders, we were as much elated by our
achievement as if it had been an arduous discovery
made after a journey in a desert. In our
elation there was some suspicion that our
experience had been secret, adventurous, and
unique. As to the crowd, we glided through
it as angels might. This building, expected
by us and known to all, astonished us as
much as the walls of Sheddad the son of Ad
unexpectedly towering would have done.</p>

<p>Sometimes in our rare London travels we had
a glimpse of a side street, a row of silent houses
all combined as it were into one gray palace,
a dark doorway, a gorgeous window, a surprising
man disappearing.... We looked,
and though we never said so, we believed that
we alone had seen these things, that they had
never been seen before. We should not have
expected to see them there if we went again.
Many and many a time have we looked, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
I alone in more recent years looked, for certain
things thus revealed to us in passing. Either
it happened that the thing was different from
what it had once been, or it had disappeared
altogether.</p>

<p>Now and then venturing down a few side
streets where the system was rectangular and
incapable of deceiving, we came on a church full
of sound or gloomily silent&mdash;I do not know
how to describe the mingled calm and pride in
the minds of the discoverers. Some of the
very quiet, apparently uninhabited courts, for
example, made us feel that corners of London
had been deserted and forgotten, that anyone
could hide away there, living in secrecy as in
a grave. Knowing how we ourselves, walking
or talking together, grew oblivious of all things
that were not within our brains, or vividly and
desirably before our eyes, feeling ourselves
isolated in proud delight, deserted and forgotten
of the multitude who were not us, we imagined,
I suppose, that houses and other things could
have a similar experience, or could share it with
us, were we to seek refuge there like Morgan
in his mountain tower. The crowd passing
and surrounding us consisted of beings unlike
us, incapable of our isolation or delight: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
retired houses whispering in quiet alleys must
be the haunt of spirits unlike the crowd and
more like us, or, if not, at least they must be
waiting in readiness for such. I recognised
in them something that linked them to Abercorran
House and distinguished them from
Brockenhurst.</p>

<p>Had these favoured houses been outwardly
as remarkable as they were in spirit they might
have pleased us more, but I am not certain. Philip
had his house with the windows that were as
the days of the year. But I came only once
near to seeing, with outward eyes, such a house
as perhaps we desired without knowing it.
Suddenly, over the tops of the third or fourth
and final ridge of roofs, visible a quarter of a
mile away from one of the windows at Abercorran
House, much taller than any of the
throng of houses and clear in the sky over
them, I saw a castle on a high rock. It resembled
St Michael’s Mount, only the rock was
giddier and had a narrower summit, and the
castle’s three clustered round towers of unequal
height stood up above it like three fingers above
a hand. When I pointed it out to Philip he
gave one dark, rapid glance as of mysterious
understanding, and looked at me, saying slowly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘A portal as of shadowy adamant</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Stands yawning on the highway of the life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which we all tread, a cavern huge and gaunt;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Around it rages an unceasing strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of shadows, like the restless clouds that haunt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gap of some cleft mountain, lifted high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the whirlwind of the upper sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many pass it by with careless tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not knowing that a shadowy....’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A shadowy <i>what</i>, Arthur? At any rate that is
the place.”</p>

<p>In those days, Philip was beginning to love
Shelley more than he loved Aurelius or me.</p>

<p>I had not seen that pile before. With little
trouble I could have located it almost exactly:
I might have known that the particular street
had no room for a sublimer St Michael’s Mount.
If we passed the spot during the next few days
we made no use of the evidence against the
tower, which satisfied us in varying degrees
until in process of time it took its place among
the other chimney clusters of our horizon.
I was not disillusioned as to this piece of fancy’s
architecture, nor was I thereafter any more
inclined to take a surveyor’s view of the surface
of the earth. Stranger things, probably, than
St Michael’s Mount have been thought and done
in that street: we did not know it, but our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
eyes accepted this symbol of them with gladness,
as in the course of nature. Not much less
fantastic was our world than the one called up
by lights seen far off before a traveller in a
foreign and a dark, wild land.</p>

<p>Therefore Spring at Lydiard Constantine was
to Philip and me more than a portion of a
regular renascence of Nature. It was not an
old country marvellously at length arraying
itself after an old custom, but an invasion of the
old as violent as our suburban St Michael’s
Mount. It was as if the black, old, silent
earth had begun to sing as sweet as when Jessie
sang unexpectedly “Blow away the morning
dew.” It was not a laborious, orderly transformation,
but a wild, divine caprice. We
supposed that it would endure for ever, though
it might (as I see now) have turned in one
night to Winter. But it did not.</p>

<p>That Spring was a poet’s Spring. “Remember
this Spring,” wrote Aurelius in a letter,
“then you will know what a poet means
when he says <i>Spring</i>.” Mr Stodham, who was
not a poet, but wrote verse passionately, was
bewildered by it, and could no longer be
kept from exposing his lines. He called the
Spring both fiercely joyous, and melancholy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
He addressed it as a girl, and sometimes as a
thousand gods. He said that it was as young
as the dew-drop freshly globed on the grass tip,
and also as old as the wind. He proclaimed
that it had conquered the earth, and that it
was as fleeting as a poppy. He praised it as
golden, as azure, as green, as snow-white, as
chill and balmy, as bright and dim, as swift and
languid, as kindly and cruel, as true and fickle.
Yet he certainly told an infinitely small part of
the truth concerning that Spring. It is memorable
to me chiefly on account of a great poet.</p>

<p>For a day or two, at Lydiard Constantine,
Philip roamed with me up and down hedgerows,
through copses, around pools, as he had done in
other Aprils, but though he found many nests
he took not one egg, not even a thrush’s egg
that was pure white and would have been unique
in his collection, or in mine; neither was I
allowed to take it. Moreover, after the first two
or three days he only came reluctantly&mdash;found
hardly any nests&mdash;quarrelled furiously with the
most faithful of the Lydiard boys for killing a
thrush (though it was a good shot) with a
catapult. He now went about muttering unintelligible
things in a voice like a clergyman.
He pushed through a copse saying magnificently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Unfathomable sea whose waves are years.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He answered an ordinary question by Aunt
Rachel with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Away, away, from men and towns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the wild wood and the downs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Tears stood in his eyes while he exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or they dead leaves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Like a somnambulist he paced along, chanting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Earth, Ocean, Air, beloved brotherhood....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sight of a solitary cottage would draw from
him those lines beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A portal as of shadowy adamant....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Over and over again, in a voice somewhere
between that of Irving and a sheep, he repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or piny promontory of the Arctic main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or utmost islet inaccessible....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With a frenzy as of one who suffered wounds,
insults, hunger and thirst and pecuniary loss,
for Liberty’s sweet sake, he cried out to the
myriad emerald leaves:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, that the wise from their bright minds would kindle</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Such lamps within the dome of this dim world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the pale name of <i>Priest</i> might shrink and dwindle</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Into the <i>Hell</i> from which it first was hurled....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He used to say to me, falling from the heights
of recitation:</p>

<p>“Shelley lived in the time of the Duke of
Wellington. He was the son of a rich old
baronet in Sussex, but he had nothing to do
with his parents as soon as he could escape from
them. He wrote the greatest lyrics that ever
were&mdash;that is, songs not meant to be sung, and
no musician could write good enough music for
them, either. He was tall, and brave, and
gentle. He feared no man, and he almost
loved death. He was beautiful. His hair was
long, and curled, and had been nearly black,
but it was going grey when he died. He was
drowned in the Mediterranean at thirty. The
other poets burnt his body on the sea-shore,
but one of them saved the heart and buried
it at Rome with the words on the stone above
it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cor cordium</i>, Heart of hearts. It is not right,
it is not right....”</p>

<p>He would mutter, “It is not right,” but what
he meant I could not tell, unless he was thus&mdash;seventy
years late&mdash;impatiently indignant at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
the passing of Shelley out of this earth. As
likely as not he would forget his indignation,
if such it was, by whispering&mdash;but not to me&mdash;with
honied milky accents, as of one whose feet
would refuse to crush a toad or bruise a flower:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fell like bright Spring upon some herbless plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How beautiful and calm and free thou wert</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And walk as free as light the clouds among,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which many an envious slave then breath’d in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From Philip’s tone as he continued the poem,
it might have been supposed that he, too, had
a young and unloved wife, a rebellious father,
a sweet-heart ready to fly with him in the
manner suggested by some other lines which he
uttered with conviction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A ship is floating in the harbour now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wind is hovering o’er the mountain’s brow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a path on the sea’s azure floor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No keel has ever ploughed the path before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The merry mariners are bold and free:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, my heart’s sister, wilt thou sail with me?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I have beside me the book which taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
Philip this sad bliss, this wild wisdom. The
fly-leaves are entirely covered by copies in
his hand-writing of the best-loved poems and
passages. Between some pages are still the
scentless skeletons of flowers and leaves&mdash;still
more pages bear the stains left by other flowers
and leaves&mdash;plucked in that spring at Lydiard
Constantine. The gilding of the covers for the
most part is worn smoothly out; the edges are
frayed, the corners broken. Thus the book
seems less the work of Shelley than of Philip.
It embalms that Spring. Yet why do I say embalmed?
It is not dead. It lives while I live
and can respond to the incantation of one of the
poems in this little book, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Life of Life, thy lips enkindle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With their love the breath between them....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When I first heard them from Philip, Spring
was thronging the land with delicious odours,
colours, and sounds. I knew how nothing
came, yet it was a sweet and natural coming
rather than magic&mdash;a term then of too narrow
application. As nearly as possible I step back
those twenty years, and see the beech leaves
under the white clouds in the blue and hear
the wood wren amongst them, whenever by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
some chance or necessity I meet that incantation:
“Life of Life, thy lips enkindle,” and I
do not understand them any more than I do
the Spring. Both have the power of magic....</p>

<p>Not magical, but enchanted away from
solidity, seems now that life at Abercorran
House, where Jessie, Ann, Aurelius, and the
rest, and the dogs, and the pigeons, sat or
played in the sun, I suppose, without us and
Shelley, throughout that April. There never
was again such another Spring, because those
that followed lacked Philip. He fell ill and
stayed on at Lydiard Constantine to be nursed
by my Aunt Rachel, while I went back to read
about the Hanseatic League, Clodia (the Lesbia
of Catullus), and other phantoms that had for
me no existence except in certain printed pages
which I would gladly have abolished. With
Philip I might have come to care about the
Hansa, and undoubtedly about Clodia; but
before I had done with them, before the cuckoos
of that poet’s Spring were silent, he was buried
at Lydiard Constantine.</p>

<p>At this point the people at Abercorran House&mdash;even
Jessie and Aurelius&mdash;and the dogs that
stretched out in deathlike blessedness under
the sun, and the pigeons that courted and were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
courted in the yard and on the roof, all suddenly
retreat from me when I come to that Spring
in memory; a haze of ghostly, shimmering
silver veils them; without Philip they are as
people in a story whose existence I cannot prove.
The very house has gone. The elms of the
Wilderness have made coffins, if they were not
too old. Where is the pond and its lilies?
They are no dimmer than the spirits of men
and children. But there is always Ann. When
“Life of Life” is eclipsed and Spring forgotten,
Ann is still in Abercorran Street. I do not
think she sees those dim hazed spirits of men
and children, dogs and pigeons. Jessie, she
tells me, is now a great lady, but rides like the
wind. Roland never leaves Caermarthenshire
except after a fox. Jack has gone to Canada
and will stay. Lewis is something on a ship.
Harry owns sheep by thousands, and rents a
mighty mountain, and has as many sons as
brothers, and the same number of daughters,
who have come to the point of resembling Jessie:
so says Ann, who has a hundred photographs.
Mr Morgan is back at Abercorran. When
good fortune returned to the Morgans the whole
family went there for a time, leaving Ann
behind until the house should be let. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
stayed a year. The family began to recover
in the country, and to scatter. Jessie married
and Jack left England within the year. Ann
became a housekeeper first to the new tenant of
Abercorran House, afterwards to Mr Jones at
Abercorran Street. Otherwise I should not
have written down these memories of the Morgans
and their friends, men, dogs, and pigeons, and
of the sunshine caught by the yard of Abercorran
House in those days, and of Our Country, and
of that Spring and the “Life of Life” which
live, and can only perish, together. Ann says
there is another world. “Not a better,” she
adds firmly. “It would be blasphemous to
suppose that God ever made any but the best of
worlds&mdash;not a better, but a different one, suitable
for different people than we are now, you understand,
not better, for that is impossible, say I,
who have lived in Abercorran&mdash;town, house, and
street&mdash;these sixty years&mdash;there is not a better
world.”</p>
